S.Lacas-Gervais S.Roques B. P.Chami M.Checler F ",Acta Neuropathol,Acta Neuropathol,One of the main components of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-affected brain is the Aβ peptide species harboring a pyroglutamate at position three pE3-Aβ. Several studies indicated that pE3-Aβ is toxic prone to aggregation and serves as a seed of Aβ aggregation. The cyclisation of the glutamate residue is produced by glutaminyl cyclase the pharmacological and genetic reductions of which significantly alleviate AD-related anatomical lesions and cognitive defects in mice models. The cyclisation of the glutamate in position 3 requires prior removal of the Aβ N-terminal aspartyl residue to allow subsequent biotransformation. The enzyme responsible for this rate-limiting catalytic step and its relevance as a putative trigger of AD pathology remained yet to be established. Here we identify aminopeptidase A as the main exopeptidase involved in the N-terminal truncation of Aβ and document its key contribution to AD-related anatomical and behavioral defects. First we show by mass spectrometry that human recombinant aminopeptidase A (APA) truncates synthetic Aβ1-40 to yield Aβ2-40. We demonstrate that the pharmacological blockade of APA with its selective inhibitor RB150 restores the density of mature spines and significantly reduced filopodia-like processes in hippocampal organotypic slices cultures virally transduced with the Swedish mutated Aβ-precursor protein (βAPP). Pharmacological reduction of APA activity and lowering of its expression by shRNA affect pE3-42Aβ- and Aβ1-42-positive plaques and expressions in 3xTg-AD mice brains. Further we show that both APA inhibitors and shRNA partly alleviate learning and memory deficits observed in 3xTg-AD mice. Importantly we demonstrate that concomitantly to the occurrence of pE3-42Aβ-positive plaques APA activity is augmented at early Braak stages in sporadic AD brains. Overall our data indicate that APA is a key enzyme involved in Aβ N-terminal truncation and suggest the potential benefit of targeting this proteolytic activity to interfere with AD pathology.,NA,"INSERM CNRS IPMC Team Labelled ""Laboratory of Excellence (LABEX) DistAlz"" Institut de Pharmacologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire Université Côte d'Azur 660 route des Lucioles Sophia-Antipolis 06560 Valbonne France.

In the light of increasing AD prevalence and lack of effective treatment, new strategies to prevent or reverse this condition are needed. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a newer antiepileptic drug that is commonly used to treat certain types of seizures. Researches indicated that LEV has several other pharmacological activities, including improvement of cognitive function. In this study, the recovery effects of chronic (28 days) administration of LEV (50, 100, and 150 mg/kg, ip) on cognitive deficits caused by the intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of streptozotocin (STZ), as a model for sporadic AD, were evaluated in rats. We also considered the protective effects of LEV against hippocampal cell loss, oxidative damage, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, neuroinflammation, and tauopathy caused by STZ. LEV (100 and 150 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the STZ-induced learning and memory impairments in the passive avoidance and Morris water maze (MWM) tasks. In addition, LEV suppressed STZ-induced hippocampal neuronal loss, while restored alterations in the redox status (lipid peroxides and glutathione), AChE activity, proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), and hyperphosphorylation of tau linked to STZ administration. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that LEV alleviated hippocampal cell death and memory deficits in STZ-AD rats, through mitigating oxidative damage, suppression of proinflammatory cytokines expression, and inhibition of abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35098412,NA,2022,10.1007/s11011-021-00888-0,,,,pubmed-35098412,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

S.Ruscher K.Sheppard O.Coleman M. P.Özen I ",Cell Death Dis,Cell Death Dis,Amyloid beta peptides (Aβ) proteins play a key role in vascular pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) including impairment of the blood-brain barrier and aberrant angiogenesis. Although previous work has demonstrated a pro-angiogenic role of Aβ the exact mechanisms by which amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and endothelial angiogenic signalling cascades interact in AD remain a largely unsolved problem. Here we report that increased endothelial sprouting in human-APP transgenic mouse (TgCRND8) tissue is dependent on β-secretase (BACE1) processing of APP. Higher levels of Aβ processing in TgCRND8 tissue coincides with decreased NOTCH3/JAG1 signalling overproduction of endothelial filopodia and increased numbers of vascular pericytes. Using a novel in vitro approach to study sprouting angiogenesis in TgCRND8 organotypic brain slice cultures (OBSCs) we find that BACE1 inhibition normalises excessive endothelial filopodia formation and restores NOTCH3 signalling. These data present the first evidence for the potential of BACE1 inhibition as an effective therapeutic target for aberrant angiogenesis in AD.,NA,"John van Geest Centre for Brain Repair Forvie Site Robinson Way Cambridge CB2 0PY UK.

M.Selkoe D. J.Li S ",Neurobiol Dis,Neurobiol Dis,As the most common cause of progressive cognitive decline in humans Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been intensively studied but the mechanisms underlying its profound synaptic dysfunction remain unclear. Here we confirm that exposing wild-type mice to an enriched environment (EE) facilitates signaling in the hippocampus that promotes long-term potentiation (LTP). Exposing the hippocampus of mice kept in standard housing to soluble Aβ oligomers impairs LTP but EE can fully prevent this. Mechanistically the key molecular features of the EE benefit are an upregulation of miRNA-132 and an inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) signaling. Specifically soluble Aβ oligomers decreased miR-132 expression and increased HDAC3 levels in cultured primary neurons. Further we provide evidence that HDAC3 is a direct target of miR-132. Overexpressing miR-132 or injecting an HDAC3 inhibitor into mice in standard housing mimics the benefits of EE in enhancing hippocampal LTP and preventing hippocampal impairment by Aβ oligomers in vivo. We conclude that EE enhances hippocampal synaptic plasticity by upregulating miRNA-132 and reducing HDAC3 signaling in a way that counteracts the synaptotoxicity of human Aβ oligomers. Our findings provide a rationale for prolonged exposure to cognitive novelty and/or epigenetic modulation to lessen the progressive effects of Aβ accumulation during human brain aging.,NA,"Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases Department of Neurology Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School Boston MA 02115 United States of America; Clinical and Translational Research Center Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital Tongji University School of Medicine Shanghai China.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) a group of chemically heterogenous medications are used widely in the treatment of inflammation. However the safety of these drugs is a growing concern due to their side effects on the gastrointestinal tract and liver. Royal jelly (RJ) is a potential functional food produced by the hypopharynx and mandibular salivary glands of nurse bees. In this study we explored the anti-neuroinflammatory effect of 10-hydroxydecanoic acid (10-HDAA) which is the second most abundant but less studied fatty acid in RJ. We showed that 10-HDAA decreased the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced elevation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) levels in both microglial BV-2 and N9 cell lines. Compared to the LPS group the 10-HDAA/LPS treated BV-2 cells had a higher level of the phagocytic receptor TREM2. RNAseq transcriptomic results showed a different transcriptional profile between the LPS group and the 10-HDAA/LPS group in BV-2 cells and the 10-HDAA pre-treatment significantly decreased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators which were further confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. Moreover we found that p53 was a target of 10-HDAA. p53 may mediate the anti-inflammation effect of 10-HDAA in two ways: first by directly deactivating the NLRP3 inflammatory pathway second by indirectly promoting autophagy. Taken together our results reveal a novel function of tumor suppressor p53 in the inhibition of neuroinflammation and provide a theoretical basis for broadening the application range of 10-HDAA and RJ.,NA,"College of Animal Sciences Zhejiang University Hangzhou 310058 China; Department of Animal Science McGill University 21 111 Lakeshore Road Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue H9X3V9 Quebec Canada.

G.Labrousse V.Grosjean N.Blanchet C.Frick A.Mulle C ",J Neurosci,J Neurosci,Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects the brain non-uniformly causing hippocampal memory deficits long before wide-spread brain degeneration becomes evident. Here we addressed whether mossy fiber inputs from the dentate gyrus onto CA3 principal cells are affected in an AD mouse model before amyloid β plaque deposition. We recorded from CA3 pyramidal cells in a slice preparation from 6-month-old male APP/PS1 mice and studied synaptic properties and intrinsic excitability. In parallel we performed a morphometric analysis of mossy fiber synapses following viral based labeling and 3D-reconstruction. We found that the basal structural and functional properties as well as presynaptic short-term plasticity at mossy fiber synapses are unaltered at 6 months in APP/PS1 mice. However transient potentiation of synaptic transmission mediated by activity-dependent release of lipids was abolished. Whereas the presynaptic form of mossy fiber long-term potentiation (LTP) was not affected the postsynaptic LTP of NMDAR-EPSCs was reduced. In addition we also report an impairment in feedforward inhibition in CA3 pyramidal cells. This study together with our previous work describing deficits at CA3-CA3 synapses provides evidence that early AD affects synapses in a projection-dependent manner at the level of a single neuronal population.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Because loss of episodic memory is considered the cognitive hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) it is important to study whether synaptic circuits involved in the encoding of episodic memory are compromised in AD mouse models. Here we probe alterations in the synaptic connections between the dentate gyrus and CA3 which are thought to be critical for enabling episodic memories to be formed and stored in CA3. We found that forms of synaptic plasticity specific to these synaptic connections are markedly impaired at an early stage in a mouse model of AD before deposition of β amyloid plaques. Together with previous work describing deficits at CA3-CA3 synapses we provide evidence that early AD affects synapses in an input-dependent manner within a single neuronal population.,NA,"University of Bordeaux Interdisciplinary Institute for Neuroscience CNRS UMR 5297 F-33000 Bordeaux France.

Dysregulation of the MAPK signaling pathway has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However the role of MKP-1 in AD pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we report that MKP-1 levels were decreased in the brain tissues of patients with AD and an AD mouse model. The reduction in MKP-1 gene expression appeared to be a result of transcriptional inhibition via transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) cis-acting binding elements in the MKP-1 gene promoter. Amyloid-β (Aβ)-induced Sp1 activation decreased MKP-1 expression. However upregulation of MKP-1 inhibited the expression of both Aβ precursor protein (APP) and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 by inactivating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK)/MAPK signaling pathway. Furthermore upregulation of MKP-1 reduced Aβ production and plaque formation and improved hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Our results demonstrate that MKP-1 impairment facilitates the pathogenesis of AD whereas upregulation of MKP-1 plays a neuroprotective role to reduce Alzheimer-related phenotypes. Thus this study suggests that MKP-1 is a novel molecule for AD treatment.,NA,"1Pediatric Research Institute Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders Chongqing Key Laboratory of Translational Medical Research in Cognitive Development and Learning and Memory Disorders Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University Chongqing 400014 PR China.

Coenzyme Q10 (Q10) is a powerful antioxidant that buffers the potential adverse consequences of free radicals. In this study we investigated the neuroprotective effects of Q10 on Aβ-induced impairment in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) a widely researched model of synaptic plasticity which occurs during learning and memory in a rat model of AD. In this study 50 adult male Wistar rats were assigned to five groups: control group (saline); sham group; intraventricular PBS injection Aβ group; intraventricular Aβ injection Q10 group; and Q10 via oral gavage and Q10 + Aβ group. Q10 was administered via oral gavage once a day for 3 weeks before and 3 weeks after the Aβ injection. After the treatment period in vivo electrophysiological recordings were performed to quantify the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) slope and population spike (PS) amplitude in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. LTP was created by a high-frequency stimulation of the perforant pathway. Following LTP induction the EPSP slope and PS amplitude were significantly diminished in Aβ-injected rats compared with sham and control rats. Q10 treatment of Aβ-injected rats significantly attenuated these decreases suggesting that Q10 reduces the effects of Aβ on LTP. Aβ significantly increased serum malondialdehyde levels and total oxidant levels whereas Q10 supplementation significantly reversed these parameters and increased total antioxidant capacity levels. The present findings suggested that Q10 treatment offers neuroprotection against the detrimental effects of Aβ on hippocampal synaptic plasticity via its antioxidant activity.,NA,"Neurophysiology Research Center Hamadan University of Medical Sciences Hamadan Iran.

Interest is growing in revealing and determining possible pathological markers also in the cerebellum as its involvement in cognitive functions is now well supported. Despite the central position of the Purkinje cell in the cerebellum, its electrophysiological behaviour in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease is scarce in the literature. Our first aim was here to focus on the electrophysiological behaviour of the cerebellum in awake mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) and the related performance on the water-maze test classically used in behavioural studies. We found prevalent signs of electrophysiological alterations in both Purkinje cells and deep cerebellar nuclei neurons which might explain the behavioural deficits reported during the water-maze test. The alterations of neurons firing were accompanied by a dual (~16 and ~228 Hz) local field potential's oscillation in the Purkinje cell layer of Alzheimer's disease mice which was concomitant to an important increase of both the simple and the complex spikes. In addition, β-amyloid deposits were present in the molecular layer of the cerebellum.

C.Babiloni C ",J Alzheimers Dis,J Alzheimers Dis,"BACKGROUND: The European PharmaCog study (http://www.pharmacog.org) has reported a reduction in delta (1-6 Hz) electroencephalographic (EEG) power (density) during cage exploration (active condition) compared with quiet wakefulness (passive condition) in PDAPP mice (hAPP Indiana V717F mutation) modeling Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloidosis and cognitive deficits. OBJECTIVE: Here we tested the reproducibility of that evidence in TASTPM mice (double mutation in APP KM670/671NL and PSEN1 M146V) which develop brain amyloidosis and cognitive deficits over aging. The reliability of that evidence was examined in four research centers of the PharmaCog study. METHODS: Ongoing EEG rhythms were recorded from a frontoparietal bipolar channel in 29 TASTPM and 58 matched ""wild type"" C57 mice (range of age: 12-24 months). Normalized EEG power was calculated. Frequency and amplitude of individual delta and theta frequency (IDF and ITF) peaks were considered during the passive and active conditions. RESULTS: Compared with the ""wild type"" group the TASTPM group showed a significantly lower reduction in IDF power during the active over the passive condition (p < 0.05). This effect was observed in 3 out of 4 EEG recording units. CONCLUSION: TASTPM mice were characterized by ""poor reactivity"" of delta EEG rhythms during the cage exploration in line with previous evidence in PDAPP mice. The reliability of that result across the centers was moderate thus unveiling pros and cons of multicenter preclinical EEG trials in TASTPM mice useful for planning future studies.",NA,"Department of Physiology and Pharmacology ""V Erspamer"" Sapienza University of Rome Rome Italy.

Abnormalities at any of these levels lead to decreased stress resilience and pathological behavior. However, temporal modulation of molecular pathways underlying stress response remains poorly understood. Transducer of ErbB2.1, known as TOB, is involved in different physiological functions, including cellular stress and immediate response to stimulation. In this study, we investigated the role of TOB in psychological stress machinery at molecular, neural circuit, and behavioral levels. Interestingly, TOB protein levels increased after mice were exposed to acute stress. At the neural circuit level, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suggested that intra-hippocampal and hippocampal-prefrontal connectivity were dysregulated in Tob knockout (Tob-KO) mice. Electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices showed increased postsynaptic AMPAR-mediated neurotransmission, accompanied by decreased GABA neurotransmission and subsequently altered Excitatory/Inhibitory balance after Tob deletion. At the behavioral level, Tob-KO mice show abnormal, hippocampus-dependent, contextual fear conditioning and extinction, and depression-like behaviors. On the other hand, increased anxiety observed in Tob-KO mice is hippocampus-independent. At the molecular level, we observed changes in factors involved in stress response like decreased stress-induced LCN2 expression and ERK phosphorylation, as well as increased MKP-1 expression. This study introduces TOB as an important modulator in the hippocampal stress signaling machinery. In summary, we reveal a molecular pathway and neural circuit mechanism by which Tob deletion contributes to expression of pathological stress-related behavior.",NA,Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences|Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University|Riken,2022,10.1038/s41398-022-02078-7,,,,scopus-2-s2.0-85135176351,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Included,Included

Its application to detect visual impairments during normal aging and over the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is evaluated in wild-type (WT) and transgenic APP(SWE)/PS1(∆E9) murine models of AD (AD(+)) across an array of irradiance chromaticity and contrast conditions. Substantial color and contrast-mode alternation deficits appear in AD(+) mice at an age when hippocampal-based memory and learning is still intact. Profiling of timespan entries and transition patterns between the different arms uncovers variable AD-associated impairments in contrast sensitivity and color discrimination reminiscent of tritanomalous defects documented in AD patients. Transition deficits are found in aged WT mice in the absence of alternation decline.

Z.Tian Q.Yu L. K.Zhou X. W ",J Alzheimers Dis,J Alzheimers Dis,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. It is reported that enzymatic degradation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plays a pivotal role in Aβ accumulation and type-2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R) participates in Aβ processing in the brain; however the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We determined that Aβ degradation-related proteins are significantly different between CB2R-/- mice and wild-type (WT) mice via proteomic analysis. Moreover the data demonstrated that the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) levels are substantially attenuated and the Aβ level is significantly enhanced in CB2R-/--Aβ1 - 42 mice compared with that of WT-Aβ1 - 42 mice. Furthermore Aβ-mediated synaptic dysfunction the loss of memory associated proteins and the suppression of glutamatergic transmission are more severe in CB2R-/--Aβ1 - 42 mice than that in WT-Aβ1 - 42 mice. CB2R activation could decrease Aβ1 - 40 and Aβ1 - 42 levels and enhance ACE and IDE levels with its selective agonist JWH133; however AM630 (CB2R antagonist) abrogates all changes induced by JWH133 in N2a cells with AβPP overexpression. Taken together our study demonstrated that the deletion of CB2R reduces exogenous Aβ degradation and aggravates the toxicity of Aβ via the reduction of ACE and IDE which suggests that CB2R is involved in the onset of AD and a potential therapeutic target for AD.,NA,"Department of Pathophysiology School of Basic Medicine Tongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science and Technology Wuhan China.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous noncoding small RNA molecules that regulate the expression and degradation of proteins. The present study induced symptoms of AD in mice via intraventricular injection of amyloidbeta 142 (Abeta142) which decreased levels of miR107. However miR107 levels increased following administration of miR107 mimic a doublestranded RNA molecule designed to imitate the native miRNA. Intraventricular injection of Abeta142 aggregates led to spatial memory impairments inhibited hippocampal longterm potentiation (LTP) and resulted in the loss of pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The miR107 mimic reversed the impairments of spatial memory and LTP and the loss of pyramidal neurons caused by Abeta neurotoxicity. Furthermore the miR107 mimic reversed the Abetainduced increase in Abeta142 and phosphorylated Tau levels. Critically Abeta142 injection decreased levels of brainderived neurotrophic factor and reduced the phosphorylation of tyrosine receptor kinase B and protein kinase B; these changes were reversed following treatment with the miR107 mimic. Collectively these results demonstrated that miR107 may be a potential target for the treatment of AD.,NA,NA,2018,10.3892/ijmm.2017.3339,,,,pubmed-29286086,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Included,Included

M.Martinez M.Torres V. I.Wong G. W.Inestrosa N. C ",J Neurochem,J Neurochem,Dysregulated Wnt signaling is linked to major neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease (AD). In mouse models of AD activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway improves learning/memory but the mechanism for this remains unclear. The decline in brain function in AD patients correlates with reduced glucose utilization by neurons. Here we test whether improvements in glucose metabolism mediate the neuroprotective effects of Wnt in AD mouse model. APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice were used to model AD Andrographolide or Lithium was used to activate Wnt signaling and cytochalasin B was used to block glucose uptake. Cognitive function was assessed by novel object recognition and memory flexibility tests. Glucose uptake and the glycolytic rate were determined using radiotracer glucose. The activities of key enzymes of glycolysis such as hexokinase and phosphofructokinase Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)/Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) levels and the pentose phosphate pathway and activity of glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase were measured. Wnt activators significantly improved brain glucose utilization and cognitive performance in transgenic mice. Wnt signaling enhanced glucose metabolism by increasing the expression and/or activity of hexokinase phosphofructokinase and AMP-activated protein kinase. Inhibiting glucose uptake partially abolished the beneficial effects of Wnt signaling on learning/memory. Wnt activation also enhanced glucose metabolism in cortical and hippocampal neurons as well as brain slices derived from APPswe/PS1E9 transgenic mice. Combined these data provide evidence that the neuroprotective effects of Wnt signaling in AD mouse models result at least in part from Wnt-mediated improvements in neuronal glucose metabolism.,NA,"Departamento de Biología Celular y Molecular Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas Centro de Envejecimiento y Regeneración (CARE-UC) Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile Santiago Chile.

C ",Front Aging Neurosci,Front Aging Neurosci,The role of the cerebellum in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been neglected for a long time. Recent studies carried out using transgenic mouse models have demonstrated that amyloid-β (Aβ) is deposited in the cerebellum and affects synaptic transmission and plasticity sometimes before plaque formation. A wide variability of motor phenotype has been observed in the different murine models of AD without a consistent correlation with the extent of cerebellar histopathological changes or with cognitive deficits. The loss of noradrenergic drive may contribute to the impairment of cerebellar synaptic function and motor learning observed in these mice. Furthermore cerebellar neurons particularly granule cells have been used as in vitro model of Aβ-induced neuronal damage. An unexpected conclusion is that the cerebellum for a long time thought to be somehow protected from AD pathology is actually considered as a region vulnerable to Aβ toxic damage even at the early stage of the disease with consequences on motor performance.,NA,"Neuroscience Institute Cavalieri Ottolenghi (NICO) Turin Italy.

Pb exposure plays a key role in the impairment of learning and memory through synaptic neurotoxicity resulting in the cognitive function. Researches have demonstrated that Pb exposure plays an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. However the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the current study a gestational Pb exposure (GLE) rat model was established to investigate the underlying mechanisms of Pb-induced cognitive impairment. We demonstrated that low-level gestational Pb exposure impaired spatial learning and memory as well as hippocampal synaptic plasticity at postnatal day 30 (PND 30) when the blood concentration of Pb had already recovered to normal levels. Pb exposure induced a decrease in hippocampal glucose metabolism by reducing glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) levels in the cell membrane through the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-Akt) pathway.

L.Li B. X.Yin L. Y.Xu B ",Neurochem Res,Neurochem Res,Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) which may be related to mitophagy failure. Previous reports suggest that treadmill exercise protects against mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. However few studies have investigated the relationship between mitophagy and mitochondrial adaptation caused by treadmill exercise in AD. The current study aimed to investigate whether exercise-ameliorated AD is associated with changes in mitophagy activity. Both Wild-type and APP/PS1 transgenic mice were divided into sedentary (WTC and ADC) and exercise (WTE and ADE) groups (n = 9 for each group). WTE and ADE mice were subjected to treadmill exercise for 12 weeks followed by evaluating the effect of treadmill exercise on learning and memory ability Aβ plaques mitochondrial Aβ peptide level synaptic activity and mitochondrial function. Meanwhile mitophagy-related proteins PINK1 Parkin LC3II and P62 were measured in the hippocampal mitochondrial fractions. The results indicated that exercise not only restored learning and memory ability but also reduced Aβ plaque area mitochondrial Aβ peptide level and increased levels of synaptic markers SYN and GAP43 as well as reversed mitochondrial dysfunction (defective mitochondrial ultrastructure decreased PGC-1α TFAM and ATP levels) in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Moreover exercise increased mitophagy activity as evidenced by a significant decrease in levels of P62 and PINK1 as well as an increase in levels of LC3II and Parkin in ADE mice. These findings suggest that treadmill exercise can enhance mitophagy activity in the hippocampus which is efficient in ameliorating pathological phenotypes of APP/PS1 transgenic mice.,NA,"Key Laboratory of Adolescent Health Assessment and Exercise Intervention of Ministry of Education East China Normal University 500 Dongchuan Road Shanghai 200241 China.

Ellagic acid (EA) is a phenolic phytoconstituent obtained from grains and fruits having evident antioxidant effects and known to modulate several endogenous molecular signals in humans in a beneficial way. The current study evaluated the safety profile of EA in the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line performing anti-oxidative effect by DPPH assay and evaluating anti-AchE (acetylcholinesterase) effect against AchE enzyme from Electrophorus electricus. The observations were further confirmed by in vivo therapeutic effects in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced SAD rats in the context of altered biochemical and behavioral features. Treatment with EA (50 mg/kg p.o.) for 30 days revealed reduction in STZ (3 mg/kg i.c.v.) prompted SAD and associated biochemical abnormalities in experimental rats which included diminished oxidative stress profile pro-inflammatory markers i.e. GFAP and CRP; AchE level and amyloid-β plaque level. Moreover an elevated level of synaptophysin indicated improved synaptic connectivity and intact neural architecture showed neuroprotection in the EA group. Furthermore the behavioral investigation by maze paradigms revealed reduced locomotor behavior irregular spontaneous alternation declination in memory score and increased memory errors in SAD rats. EA treatment normalized these SAD-associated abnormal behavioral representations in rats. Hence our findings suggest neuroprotective effects of EA and improvement in cognitive behavior in SAD rats.,NA,"Department of Pharmacology Institute of Pharmacy Nirma University Ahmedabad 382481 Gujarat India.

R.Williams S. C. R.Killick R.Cash D ",Sci Rep,Sci Rep,Amyloid plaques are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that develop in its earliest stages. Thus non-invasive detection of these plaques would be invaluable for diagnosis and the development and monitoring of treatments but this remains a challenge due to their small size. Here we investigated the utility of manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) for visualizing plaques in transgenic rodent models of AD across two species: 5xFAD mice and TgF344-AD rats. Animals were given subcutaneous injections of MnCl(2) and imaged in vivo using a 9.4 T Bruker scanner. MnCl(2) improved signal-to-noise ratio but was not necessary to detect plaques in high-resolution images. Plaques were visible in all transgenic animals and no wild-types and quantitative susceptibility mapping showed that they were more paramagnetic than the surrounding tissue. This combined with beta-amyloid and iron staining indicate that plaque MR visibility in both animal models was driven by plaque size and iron load. Longitudinal relaxation rate mapping revealed increased manganese uptake in brain regions of high plaque burden in transgenic animals compared to their wild-type littermates. This was limited to the rhinencephalon in the TgF344-AD rats while it was most significantly increased in the cortex of the 5xFAD mice. Alizarin Red staining suggests that manganese bound to plaques in 5xFAD mice but not in TgF344-AD rats. Multi-parametric MEMRI is a simple viable method for detecting amyloid plaques in rodent models of AD. Manganese-induced signal enhancement can enable higher-resolution imaging which is key to visualizing these small amyloid deposits. We also present the first in vivo evidence of manganese as a potential targeted contrast agent for imaging plaques in the 5xFAD model of AD.,NA,"BRAIN Centre (Biomarker Research and Imaging for Neuroscience) Department of Neuroimaging King's College London The James Black Centre 125 Coldharbour Lane London SE5 9NU UK. eugene.kim@kcl.ac.uk.

However the related molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Microglial toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) are two key regulators of inflammation that may play an essential role in this complex pathophysiological process. In this study intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into APP/PS1 transgenic AD model was used to mimic systemic inflammation in the development of AD. Initial results from the cortex showed that compared with wild-type mice APP/PS1 mice exhibited elevated gene and protein expression levels of both TLR4 and TREM2 with different degree. Interestingly after LPS treatment TLR4 expression was persistently up-regulated while TREM2 expression was significantly down-regulated in APP/PS1 mice suggesting that the negative regulatory effect of TREM2 on inflammation might be suppressed by LPS-induced hyperactive TLR4. This imbalance of TLR4/TREM2 contributed to microglial over-activation followed by increased neuronal apoptosis in the cortex of APP/PS1 mice; these changes did not alter the expression level of Aβ(1-42). Similar alterations were observed in our in vitro experiment with β-amyloid(1-42) (Aβ(1-42))-treated N9 microglia. Further Morris water maze (MWM) testing data indicated that LPS administration acutely aggravated cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice suggesting that the addition of systemic inflammation can potentially accelerate the progression of AD. Collectively we conclude that an imbalance of TLR4/TREM2 may be a potential link between AD and systemic inflammation. TREM2 can serve as a potential therapeutic target for treating systemic inflammation in AD progression.,NA,"Department of Geriatrics The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University 1 Youyi Road Yuzhong District Chongqing 400016 China.

C ",Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and neurodegenerative disorder of the cortex and hippocampus which eventually leads to cognitive impairment. Although the etiology of AD remains unclear the presence of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides in these learning and memory regions is a hallmark of AD. Therefore the inhibition of Aβ peptide aggregation has been considered the primary therapeutic strategy for AD treatment. Many studies have shown that resveratrol has antioxidant anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties and can decrease the toxicity and aggregation of Aβ peptides in the hippocampus of AD patients promote neurogenesis and prevent hippocampal damage. In addition the antioxidant activity of resveratrol plays an important role in neuronal differentiation through the activation of silent information regulator-1 (SIRT1). SIRT1 plays a vital role in the growth and differentiation of neurons and prevents the apoptotic death of these neurons by deacetylating and repressing p53 activity; however the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Resveratrol also has anti-inflammatory effects as it suppresses M1 microglia activation which is involved in the initiation of neurodegeneration and promotes Th2 responses by increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines and SIRT1 expression. This review will focus on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory neuroprotective effects of resveratrol specifically on its role in SIRT1 and the association with AD pathophysiology.,NA,"Neuroscience and Cell Biology Graduate Program Institute of Biological Sciences Federal University of Pará Belém Pará Brazil.

Y.Waro G.Tsunoda S ",Cell Rep,Cell Rep,Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) is the ability of neurons to exert compensatory changes in response to altered neural activity. How pathologically induced activity changes are intertwined with HSP mechanisms is unclear. We show that in cholinergic neurons from Drosophila beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides Aβ40 and Aβ42 both induce an increase in spontaneous activity. In a transgenic line expressing Aβ42 we observe that this early increase in spontaneous activity is followed by a dramatic reduction in spontaneous events a progression that has been suggested to occur in cholinergic brain regions of mammalian models of Alzheimer's disease. We present evidence that the early enhancement in synaptic activity is mediated by the Drosophila α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and that later Aβ42-induced inhibition of synaptic events is a consequence of Dα7-dependent HSP mechanisms induced by earlier hyperactivity. Thus while HSP may initially be an adaptive response it may also drive maladaptive changes and downstream pathologies.,NA,"Department of Biomedical Sciences Colorado State University 1617 Campus Delivery Fort Collins CO 80523 USA.

In the synaptic context the actin cytoskeleton is a crucial element to maintain the dendritic spine architecture and to orchestrate the spine's morphology remodeling driven by synaptic activity. Indeed spine shape and synaptic strength are strictly correlated and precisely governed during plasticity phenomena in order to convert short-term alterations of synaptic strength into long-lasting changes that are embedded in stable structural modification. These functional and structural modifications are considered the biological basis of learning and memory processes. In this review we discussed the existing evidence regarding the role of the spine actin cytoskeleton in AD synaptic failure. We revised the physiological function of the actin cytoskeleton in the spine shaping and the contribution of actin dynamics in the endocytosis mechanism. The internalization process is implicated in different aspects of AD since it controls both glutamate receptor membrane levels and amyloid generation.

Spatial cognition measured by reference and working memory testing in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) were altered in young NonTg and 3xTg.

By contrast the old control 3xTg mice exhibited hyper-excitable synaptic transmission enhanced PPF and unstable LTP compared to NonTg controls. Repeated Iso exposures reduced synaptic transmission and PPF in neonatal NonTg and old 3xTg mice. LTP was normalized in old 3xTg mice but reduced in neonates. By contrast LTP was reduced in old but not neonatal NonTg mice.

Moreover reactive astrocytes are now emerging as heterogeneous cells and all types of astrocyte reactivity may not be controlled efficiently by such strategies.Here we used cell type-specific approaches in vivo and identified the JAK2-STAT3 pathway as necessary and sufficient for the induction and maintenance of astrocyte reactivity. Modulation of this cascade by viral gene transfer in mouse astrocytes efficiently controlled several morphological and molecular features of reactivity. Inhibition of this pathway in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease improved three key pathological hallmarks by reducing amyloid deposition improving spatial learning and restoring synaptic deficits.In conclusion the JAK2-STAT3 cascade operates as a master regulator of astrocyte reactivity in vivo. Its inhibition offers new therapeutic opportunities for Alzheimer's disease.,NA,"Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives Département de la Recherche Fondamentale Institut de Biologie François Jacob MIRCen 92260 Fontenay-aux-Roses France.

P.Manfredsson F. P.Sandoval I. M.Johnson P. F.Jia J.Wang J. Z.Ye K ",Nat Commun,Nat Commun,Delta-secretase cleaves both APP and Tau to mediate the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However how aging contributes to an increase in delta-secretase expression and AD pathologies remains unclear. Here we show that a CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ) an inflammation-regulated transcription factor acts as a key age-dependent effector elevating both delta-secretase (AEP) and inflammatory cytokines expression in mediating pathogenesis in AD mouse models. We find that C/EBPβ regulates delta-secretase transcription and protein levels in an age-dependent manner. Overexpression of C/EBPβ in young 3xTg mice increases delta-secretase and accelerates the pathological features including cognitive dysfunctions which is abolished by inactive AEP C189S. Conversely depletion of C/EBPβ from old 3xTg or 5XFAD mice diminishes delta-secretase and reduces AD pathologies leading to amelioration of cognitive impairment in these AD mouse models. Thus our findings support that C/EBPβ plays a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis via increasing delta-secretase expression.,NA,"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Emory University School of Medicine Atlanta GA 30322 USA.

K.Herrmann A. G.Jain P.Stevenson A. J.Oren I.Hardt O.Spires-Jones T. L ",Eur J Neurosci,Eur J Neurosci,One of the key knowledge gaps in the field of Alzheimer's disease research is the lack of understanding of how amyloid beta and tau cooperate to cause neurodegeneration. We recently generated a mouse model (APP/PS1 + Tau) that develops amyloid plaque pathology and expresses human tau in the absence of endogenous murine tau. These mice exhibit an age-related behavioural hyperactivity phenotype and transcriptional deficits which are ameliorated by tau transgene suppression. We hypothesized that these mice would also display memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits as has been reported for many plaque bearing mouse models which express endogenous mouse tau. We observed that our APP/PS1 + Tau model does not exhibit novel object memory or robust long-term potentiation deficits with age whereas the parent APP/PS1 line with mouse tau did develop the expected deficits. These data are important as they highlight potential functional differences between mouse and human tau and the need to use multiple models to fully understand Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic strategies.,NA,"Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences and UK Dementia Research Institute The University of Edinburgh Edinburgh UK.

Y.Liu P.Jin G.Xu Q.Jiao Q.Wang L. H.Zou L. B ",European Journal of Pharmacology,European Journal of Pharmacology,Xanthoceraside a novel triterpenoid saponin extracted from the husks of Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge has neuroprotective effects in vivo and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro. However the exact mechanism of xanthoceraside on anti-amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced neuroinflammatory responses has not been elucidated. Therefore we used intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid <inf>1-42</inf> (Abeta<inf>1-42</inf>) to establish a mouse model to test the effects of xanthoceraside on Abeta-induced cognitive impairments and the TLR2/NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways. The mice received xanthoceraside (0.02 0.08 or 0.32 mg/kg) or vehicle from the day of Abeta<inf>1-42</inf> injection. The Morris water maze test was performed 4 days after Abeta<inf>1-42</inf> injection. The levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-4) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b) in the hippocampus were determined with an immunohistochemistry assay. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were analysed by Western blotting; iNOS COX-2 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) mRNA expression levels were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Here we observed that xanthoceraside at doses of 0.08 and 0.32 mg/kg significantly improved learning and memory impairments and significantly inhibited GFAP and CD11b overexpression induced by Abeta<inf>1-42</inf> in mice. ELISA results revealed that xanthoceraside suppressed IL-6 release and increased IL-4 levels. Western blotting results showed that xanthoceraside reduced iNOS and COX-2 protein levels in hippocampus; xanthoceraside also inhibited translocation of NF-kappaB p50 and p65 into the nucleus and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. RT-PCR confirmed that xanthoceraside decreased iNOS COX-2 and TLR2 mRNA levels. These results suggest that xanthoceraside inhibition of the TLR2 pathway and down-regulation of MAPK and NF-kappaB activities may be related to the improvement in learning and memory impairments.

C.de Almeida G. R. L.Cunha M. P.Dafre A. L ",Neurochem Res,Neurochem Res,Methylglyoxal (MGO) is a highly reactive dicarbonyl molecule that promotes the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) which are believed to play a key role in a number of pathologies such as diabetes Alzheimer's disease and inflammation. Here Swiss mice were treated with MGO by intraperitoneal injection to investigate its effects on motor activity mood and cognition. Acute MGO treatment heavily decreased locomotor activity in the open field test at higher doses (80-200 mg/kg) an effect not observed at lower doses (10-50 mg/kg). Several alterations were observed 4 h after a single MGO injection (10-50 mg/kg): (a) plasma MGO levels were increased (b) memory was impaired (object location task) (c) anxiolytic behavior was observed in the open field and marble burying test and (d) depressive-like behavior was evidenced as evaluated by the tail suspension test. Biochemical alterations in the glutathione and glyoxalase systems were not observed 4 h after MGO treatment. Mice were also treated daily with MGO at 0 10 25 and 50 mg/kg for 11 days. From the 5th to the 11th day several behavioral end points were evaluated resulting in: (a) absence of motor impairment as evaluated in the open field horizontal bars and pole test (b) depressive-like behavior observed in the tail suspension test and (c) cognitive impairments detected on working short- and long-term memory when mice were tested in the Y-maze spontaneous alternation object location and recognition tests and step-down inhibitory avoidance task. An interesting finding was a marked decrease in dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex of mice treated with 50 mg/kg MGO for 11 days along with a ~ 25% decrease in the Glo1 content. The MGO-induced dopamine depletion in the prefrontal cortex may be related to the observed memory deficits and depressive-like behavior an interesting topic to be further studied as a potentially novel route for MGO toxicity.,NA,"Neurosciences Post-Graduation Program Federal University of Santa Catarina Florianópolis SC 88040-900 Brazil.

B.Xie X. Y.Chen S. W.Huang Q.Huang W. Y.Zhang R.Chen H. Z.Wang H.Wang G ",Aging Cell,Aging Cell,Different cellular and molecular changes underlie the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among these neuron-specific dysregulation is a necessary event for accumulation of classic pathologies including amyloid plaques. Here we show that AD-associated pathophysiology including neuronal cell death inflammatory signaling and endolysosomal dysfunction is spatially colocalized to amyloid plaques in regions with abnormal microRNA-425 (miR-425) levels and this change leads to focal brain microenvironment heterogeneity that is an amyloid plaque-associated microenvironment (APAM). APAM consists of multiple specific neurodegenerative signature pathologies associated with senile plaques that contribute to the heterogeneity and complexity of AD. Remarkably miR-425 a neuronal-specific regulator decreased in AD brain maintains a normal spatial transcriptome within brain neurons. We tested the hypothesis that miR-425 loss correlates with enhanced levels of mRNA targets downstream supporting APAM and AD progression. A miR-425-deficient mouse model has enhanced APP amyloidogenic processing neuroinflammation neuron loss and cognitive impairment. In the APP/PS1 mouse model intervening with miR-425 supplementation ameliorated APAM changes and memory deficits. This study reveals a novel mechanism of dysregulation of spatial transcriptomic changes in AD brain identifying a probable neuronal-specific microRNA regulator capable of staving off amyloid pathogenesis. Moreover our findings provide new insights for developing AD treatment strategies with miRNA oligonucleotide(s).,NA,"Department of Neurology and Neuroscience Institute Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine Shanghai China.

A major aim was to evaluate the efficacy of infliximab (IFX) either individually or in combination with 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate sodium (MESNA) on the DOX-induced neurotoxicity in rats. AD-like pathology was induced in adult male Wistar rats by intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of DOX at a dose of 3.5 mg/kg twice a week for 3 weeks. DOX-injected rats were then treated with either INF at a single dose of 5 mg/kg i.p.

DOX-treated rats significantly exhibited AD-like brain injury, increased amyloid burden, enhanced neuroinflammation and apoptosis, and multifocal histological injury in the cerebral cortex with widespread vacuolations. IFX and MESNA significantly reversed all the aforementioned detrimental effects in the DOX-treated rats.

Y.Zhang C. H.Yang J. J.Xu P. P.Yi P. J.Hu M. L.Peng W. J ",J Integr Med,J Integr Med,OBJECTIVE: Bushen Tiansui formula (BSTSF) a traditional Chinese medicine prescription has been widely used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). However the mechanisms underlying its effects remain largely unknown. In this study a rat AD model was used to study the effects of BSTSF on cognitive performance and expression of transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) in the hippocampus to determine whether treatment of AD with BSTSF could regulate the expression of tsRNAs a novel small non-coding RNA. METHODS: To generate a validated AD model oligomeric amyloid-β(1-42) (Aβ(1-42)) was injected intracerebroventricularly into rats. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was used to evaluate rat cognitive performance and tsRNA-sequencing was conducted to examine tsRNA expression in the rat hippocampus. Potential targets were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Bioinformatic analyses were conducted to investigate the biological function of candidate tsRNAs. RESULTS: The learning and memory deficits of Aβ(1-42)-induced AD rats assessed by MWM tests were clearly ameliorated by BSTSF treatment. A total of 387 tsRNAs were detected in the rat hippocampus. Among them 13 were significantly dysregulated in AD rats compared with sham control rats while 57 were markedly altered by BSTSF treatment relative to untreated AD rats (fold change ≥ 2 and P < 0.05). Moreover six BSTSF treatment-related tsRNAs were identified and validated by qRT-PCR. Bioinformatic analyses indicated that the six treatment-related tsRNAs had potential therapeutic roles via multiple signaling pathways and Gene Ontology biological functions including cyclic adenosine monophosphate and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling. CONCLUSION: This study identified a previously uncharacterized mechanism underlying the effects of BSTSF in alleviating the learning and memory deficits in Aβ(1-42)-induced AD rats demonstrating that tsRNAs are potential therapeutic targets of BSTSF in the treatment of AD.,NA,"Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese & Western Medicine the Second Xiangya Hospital Central South University Changsha 410011 Hunan Province China.

H ",Heliyon,Heliyon,Decades of research attempting to slow the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) indicates that a better understanding of memory will be key to the discovery of effective therapeutic approaches. Here we ask whether prodromal neural network dysfunction might occur in the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit by using α5IA (an established memory enhancer and selective negative allosteric modulator of extrasynaptic tonically active α5GABA-A receptors) as a probe drug in TgF344-AD transgenic rats a model for β-amyloid induced early onset AD. The results demonstrate that orally bioavailable α5IA increases CA1 pyramidal cell mean firing rates during foraging and peak ripple amplitude during wakeful immobility in wild type F344 rats in a familiar environment. We further demonstrate that CA1 ripples in TgF344-AD rats are nonresponsive to α5IA by 9 months of age prior to the onset of AD-like pathology and memory dysfunction. TgF344-AD rats express human β-amyloid precursor protein (with the Swedish mutation) and human presenilin-1 (with a Δ exon 9 mutation) and we found high serum Aβ42 and Aβ40 levels by 3 months of age. When taken together this demonstrates to the best of our knowledge the first evidence for prodromal α5GABA-A receptor dysfunction in the ripple-generating hippocampal trisynaptic circuit of AD-like transgenic rats. As α5GABA-A receptors are found at extrasynaptic and synaptic contacts we posit that negative modulation of α5GABA-A receptor mediated tonic as well as phasic inhibition augments CA1 ripples and memory consolidation but that this modulatory mechanism is lost at an early stage of AD onset.,NA,"Department of Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics Boston University School of Medicine Boston Massachusetts USA.

Z.Tseng G. F ",Brain Struct Funct,Brain Struct Funct,Rostral intralaminar thalamic deep brain stimulation (ILN-DBS) has been shown to enhance attention and cognition through neuronal activation and brain plasticity. We examined whether rostral ILN-DBS can also attenuate memory deficits and impaired synaptic plasticity and protect glutamatergic transmission in the rat intraventricular β-amyloid (Aβ) infusion model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Spatial memory was tested in the Morris water maze (MWM) while structural synaptic plasticity and glutamatergic transmission strength were estimated by measuring dendritic spine densities in dye-injected neurons and tissue expression levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus. All these assessments were compared among the naïve control rats AD rats and AD rats with ILN-DBS. We found that a single rostral ILN-DBS treatment significantly improved MWM performance and reversed PSD-95 expression reductions in the mPFC and hippocampal region of Aβ-infused rats. In addition ILN-DBS preserved dendritic spine densities on mPFC and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. In fact MWM performance PSD-95 expression levels and dendritic spine densities did not differ between naïve control and rostral ILN-DBS treatment groups indicating near complete amelioration of Aβ-induced spatial memory impairments and dendritic regression. These findings suggest that the ILN is critical for modulating glutamatergic transmission neural plasticity and spatial memory functions through widespread effects on distributed brain regions. Further these findings provide a rationale for examining the therapeutic efficacy of ILN-DBS in AD patients.,NA,"Department of Neurosurgery Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation/Tzu Chi University Hualien Taiwan.

But the role of CysLT(1)R in AD and its underlying mechanisms still remain elusive. In this study we investigated CysLT(1)R levels in AD patients and APP/PS1 mice. We also generated APP/PS1-CysLT(1)R(-/-) mice by clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated CysLT(1)R deletion in APP/PS1 mice and studied the effect of CysLT(1)R knockout on amyloidogenesis synapse structure and plasticity cognition neuroinflammation and kynurenine pathway. These attributes were also studied after lentivirus-mediated knockdown of CysLT(1)R gene in APP/PS1 mice. We found that CysLT(1)R knockout or knockdown could conserve synaptic structure and plasticity and improve cognition in APP/PS1 mice. These effects were associated with concurrent decreases in amyloid processing reduced neuroinflammation and suppression of the kynurenine pathway. Our study demonstrates that CysLT(1)R deficiency can mediate several beneficial effects against AD pathogenesis and genetic/pharmacological ablation of this protein could be a potential therapeutic option for AD.,NA,"Department of Pharmacology China Pharmaceutical University Nanjing China.

This review examines the latest evidence of a novel and newly introduced perspective which focuses on the restoration of gamma oscillations and investigates their potential role in the treatment of AD. Gamma brain activity (∼25-100 Hz) has been well-known for its role in cognitive function including memory and it is fundamental for healthy brain activity and intra-brain communication. Aberrant gamma oscillations have been observed in both mice AD models and human AD patients. A recent line of work demonstrated that gamma entrainment through auditory and visual sensory stimulation can effectively attenuate AD pathology and improve cognitive function in mice models of the disease. The first evidence from AD patients indicate that gamma entrainment therapy can reduce loss of functional connectivity and brain atrophy improve cognitive function and ameliorate several pathological markers of the disease. Even though research is still in its infancy evidence suggests that gamma-based therapy may have a disease-modifying effect and has signified a new and promising era in AD research.,NA,Department of Rehabilitation Sciences Faculty of Health Sciences Cyprus University of Technology Limassol Cyprus.,2021,10.3389/fnsys.2021.782399,,,,pubmed-34966263,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

We have known for a long time that natural compounds and their derivatives have gained increasing attention in AD drug research due to their multiple effects and inherently enormous chemicals. In this study we will demonstrate that polysaccharides from L. barbarum (LBP1) a traditional natural compound can reduce Aβ level and improve the cognitive functions in APP/PS1 transgenic mouse. LBP1 can enhance neurogenesis as indicated by BrdU/NeuN double labeling. Furthermore it can restore synaptic dysfunction at hippocampus CA3-CA1 pathway. Additionally in vitro cell assay indicates that LBP1 may affect Aβ processing.

Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that Sansoninto (SST; 酸棗仁湯 suān zǎo rén tāng), a traditional herbal medicine, attenuates stress-induced abnormal behavior in rodents. However, it is unknown whether SST attenuates stress-induced aggressive behavior. The current study examined the effects of SST on aggressive behavior of mice who suffered from social isolation (SI) stress in adolescence. Experimental procedure: Five-week old mice were socially isolated for 6 weeks, and SST administration was started at 4 weeks after starting SI. Aggressive behavior and locomotor activity were examined in SST-treated mice. The content of dopamine and its metabolites in the hypothalamus were examined using high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Gene expression analyses of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and tyrosine hydroxylase in the hypothalamus were performed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results and conclusion: SST attenuated SI-induced aggressive behavior and increased levels of homovanillic acid, a metabolite of dopamine. However, SST did not affect dopamine levels. SI enhanced locomotion in a novel environment and increased COMT mRNA levels. In contrast, SST-treated mice showed no significant enhancement of locomotion. SST attenuated the increase in COMT mRNA levels. Given that the dopaminergic system has been implicated in aggressive behavior, these findings suggest that SST toned down dopaminergic signaling, resulting in amelioration of aggression. SST may be useful for treatment of aggressive behavior in patients with neurotic symptoms.",NA,Fukuoka University,2022,10.1016/j.jtcme.2021.08.006,,,,scopus-2-s2.0-85112526164,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b;03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Laurel Renton;Ella Lambert,Excluded;Excluded,Excluded

Recent evidence indicates that amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) is trafficked to synapses and promotes their formation. At the synapse AβPP interacts with synaptic proteins involved in vesicle exocytosis and affects calcium channel function. OBJECTIVE: Herein we examined the role of AβPP in depolarization-induced calcium-mediated signaling using acute cerebral slices from wild-type C57bl/6 mice and AβPP-/- C57bl/6 mice. METHODS: Depolarization of acute cerebral slices from wild-type C57bl/6 and AβPP-/- C57bl/6 mice was used to induce synaptic signaling. Protein levels were examined by western blot and calcium dynamics were assessed using primary neuronal cultures. RESULTS: In the absence of AβPP decreased pCaMKII and pERKs levels were observed. This decrease was sensitive to the inhibition of N- and P/Q-type Voltage Gated Calcium Channels (N- and P/Q-VGCCs) by ω-conotoxin GVIA and ω-conotoxin MVIIC respectively but not to inhibition of L-type VGCCs by nifedipine. However the absence of AβPP did not result in a statistically significant decrease of pCREB which is a known substrate of pERKs. Finally using calcium imaging we found that down regulation of AβPP in cortical neurons results in a decreased response to depolarization and altered kinetics of calcium response. CONCLUSION: AβPP regulates synaptic activity-mediated neuronal signaling by affecting N- and P/Q-VGCCs.,NA,Department of Biology Division of Animal and Human Physiology National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Panepistimiopolis Ilisia Greece.,2020,10.3233/jad-200290,,,,pubmed-32597808,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded
1b4fc784-58b1-4312-8562-e6b1be38be5b,Drosophila as a Model to Study the Relationship Between Sleep Plasticity and Memory,"Dissel S ",Front Physiol,Front Physiol,Humans spend nearly a third of their life sleeping yet despite decades of research the function of sleep still remains a mystery. Sleep has been linked with various biological systems and functions including metabolism immunity the cardiovascular system and cognitive functions. Importantly sleep appears to be present throughout the animal kingdom suggesting that it must provide an evolutionary advantage. Among the many possible functions of sleep the relationship between sleep and cognition has received a lot of support. We have all experienced the negative cognitive effects associated with a night of sleep deprivation. These can include increased emotional reactivity poor judgment deficit in attention impairment in learning and memory and obviously increase in daytime sleepiness. Furthermore many neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease often have a sleep disorder component. In some cases the sleep disorder can exacerbate the progression of the neurological disease. Thus it is clear that sleep plays an important role for many brain functions. In particular sleep has been shown to play a positive role in the consolidation of long-term memory while sleep deprivation negatively impacts learning and memory. Importantly sleep is a behavior that is adapted to an individual's need and influenced by many external and internal stimuli. In addition to being an adaptive behavior sleep can also modulate plasticity in the brain at the level of synaptic connections between neurons and neuronal plasticity influences sleep. Understanding how sleep is modulated by internal and external stimuli and how sleep can modulate memory and plasticity is a key question in neuroscience. In order to address this question several animal models have been developed. Among them the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster with its unparalleled genetics has proved to be extremely valuable. In addition to sleep Drosophila has been shown to be an excellent model to study many complex behaviors including learning and memory. This review describes our current knowledge of the relationship between sleep plasticity and memory using the fly model.,NA,Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry School of Biological and Chemical Sciences University of Missouri-Kansas City Kansas City MO United States.,2020,10.3389/fphys.2020.00533,,,,pubmed-32547415,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b,Laurel Renton,Excluded,Excluded

J ",Neuroscience,Neuroscience,Cognitive deficits and alterations in emotional behaviour are typical features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover exposure to stress or adversity during the early life period has been associated with an acceleration of cognitive deficits and increased AD pathology in transgenic AD mouse models. Whether and how early life adversity affects fear memory in AD mice remains elusive. We therefore investigated whether exposure to early life stress (ELS) alters fear learning in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice a classic mouse model for AD and whether this is accompanied by alterations in hippocampal synaptic potentiation an important cellular substrate for learning and memory. Transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were subjected to ELS by housing the dams and her pups with limited nesting and bedding material from postnatal days 2-9. Following a fear conditioning paradigm 12-month-old ELS-exposed APPswe/PS1dE9 mice displayed enhanced contextual freezing behaviour both in the conditioning context and in a novel context. ELS-exposed APPswe/PS1dE9 mice also displayed enhanced hippocampal synaptic potentiation even in the presence of the GluN2B antagonist Ro25-6981 (which prevented synaptic potentiation in control mice). No differences in the level of PSD-95 or synaptophysin were observed between the groups. We conclude that in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice ELS increases fear memory in the conditioning context as well as a novel context which is accompanied by aberrant hippocampal synaptic potentiation. These results may help to understand how individual differences in the vulnerability to develop AD arise and emphasise the importance of the early postnatal time window in these differences.

Accordingly, the animals in NS and sericin-treated groups were subjected to 1 day learned helplessness protocol. Behavioral deficits were evaluated and alterations in both synaptic and apoptotic factors were evaluated in the hippocampus. Induction of LH was associated with behavioral changes (depression and cognitive impairment). On the other hand, the administration of sericin effectively normalized these deficits.

H.Holscher C.Yang J. T.Wu M. N.Wang Z. J.Cai H. Y.Han L. N.Shi H.Han Y. F.Qi J. S ",J Alzheimers Dis,J Alzheimers Dis,BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive decline in cognitive function. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an important risk factor for AD. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) has been identified to be effective in T2DM treatment and neuroprotection. OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the neuroprotective effects and possible mechanisms of DAla2GIP-Glu-PAL a novel long-lasting GIP analogue in APP/PS1 AD mice. METHODS: Multiple behavioral tests were performed to examine the cognitive function of mice. In vivo hippocampus late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) was recorded to reflect synaptic plasticity. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to examine the Aβ plaques and neuroinflammation in the brain. IL-1β TNF-α and cAMP/PKA/CREB signal molecules were also detected by ELISA or western blotting. RESULTS: DAla2GIP-Glu-PAL increased recognition index (RI) of APP/PS1 mice in novel object recognition test elevated spontaneous alternation percentage of APP/PS1 mice in Y maze test and increased target quadrant swimming time of APP/PS1 mice in Morris water maze test. DAla2GIP-Glu-PAL treatment enhanced in vivo L-LTP of APP/PS1 mice. DAla2GIP-Glu-PAL significantly reduced Aβ deposition inhibited astrocyte and microglia proliferation and weakened IL-1β and TNF-α secretion. DAla2GIP-Glu-PAL also upregulated cAMP/PKA/CREB signal transduction and inhibited NF-κB activation in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSION: DAla2GIP-Glu-PAL can improve cognitive behavior synaptic plasticity and central pathological damage in APP/PS1 mice which might be associated with the inhibition of neuroinflammation as well as upregulation of cAMP-/PKA/CREB signaling pathway.

J.Gallegos S.Armijo-Weingart L.Araya A.Riffo-Lepe N. O.Cayuman F.Aguayo L. G ",Scientific Reports,Scientific Reports,Several previous studies showed that hippocampus and cortex are affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However other brain regions have also been found to be affected and could contribute with new critical information to the pathophysiological basis of AD. For example volumetric studies in humans have shown a significant atrophy of the striatum particularly in the nucleus Accumbens (nAc). The nAc is a key component of the limbic reward system and it is involved in cognition and emotional behaviors such as pleasure fear aggression and motivations all of which are affected in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. However its role in AD has not been extensively studied. Therefore using an AD mouse model we investigated if the nAc was affected in 6 months old transgenic 2xTg (APP/PS1) mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis in 2xTg mice showed increased intraneuronal A beta accumulation as well as occasional extracellular amyloid deposits detected through Thioflavin-S staining. Interestingly the intracellular A beta pathology was associated to an increase in membrane excitability in dissociated medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the nAc. IHC and western blot analyses showed a decrease in glycine receptors (GlyR) together with a reduction in the pre- and post-synaptic markers SV2 and gephyrin respectively which correlated with a decrease in glycinergic miniature synaptic currents in nAc brain slices. Additionally voltage-clamp recordings in dissociated MSNs showed a decrease in AMPA- and Gly-evoked currents. Overall these results showed intracellular A beta accumulation together with an increase in excitability and synaptic alterations in this mouse model. These findings provide new information that might help to explain changes in motivation anhedonia and learning in the onset of AD pathogenesis.,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000594824100033,"[Fernandez-Perez E.

The pathological mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) a common neurodegenerative disease remain largely unknown. Altered brain laterality has been demonstrated in aging people but whether or not abnormal lateralization is one of the early signs of AD has not been determined. To investigate this we recorded bilateral LFPs in 3-5-month-old AD model mice APP/PS1 together with littermate wild type (WT) controls. The LFPs of the left and right secondary motor cortex (M2) specifically in the gamma band were more synchronized in APP/PS1 mice than in WT controls suggesting a declined hemispheric asymmetry of bilateral M2 in this AD mouse model. Notably the recording and data analysis processes are flexible and easy to carry out and can also be applied to other brain pathways when conducting experiments that focus on neuronal circuits.,NA,"School of Life Sciences Guangzhou University; Institute for Brain Research and Rehabilitation South China Normal University.

Although the primary target of influenza viruses is the lung infection may manifest with acute and even chronic neurological complications (e.g. status epilepticus encephalopathies and encephalitis) potentially increasing the long-term risk for neurodegenerative diseases. We previously described that a peripheral influenza A virus (IAV) infection caused by non-neurotropic H3N2 (maHK68) variant leads to long-term neuroinflammation and synapse loss together with impaired memory formation in young adult mice. Processes of neuroinflammation have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prolonged or excessive innate immune responses are considered a risk factor for AD. Here the role of purely peripheral IAV infection for the development and progression of AD in a transgenic mouse model (APP/PS1) was investigated. At 2 months of age mice were infected with H3N2 IAV and the detailed analysis of microglia morphology revealed neuroinflammation in the hippocampus already of 6 months old non-infected APP/PS1 mice together with impaired spatial learning however microglia activation amyloid-β plaques load and cognitive impairments were even more pronounced in APP/PS1 mice upon H3N2 infection. Moreover CA1 hippocampal dendritic spine density was reduced even at 120 dpi compared to wild-type and also to non-infected APP/PS1 mice whereas neuronal cells number was not altered. These findings demonstrate that non-neurotropic H3N2 IAV infection as a peripheral immune stimulation may exacerbate AD symptoms possibly by triggering microglial hyperactivation.,NA,"Department of Cellular Neurobiology Zoological Institute TU-Braunschweig Braunschweig Germany.

The pathology propagates to neighboring cerebral regions through a prion-like mechanism. In AD intracellular calcium dyshomeostasis is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This study was designed to examine hippocampal ER stress following EC amyloidopathy. Aβ1-42 was bilaterally microinjected into the EC under stereotaxic surgery. Rats were daily treated with 30 μg of isradipine nimodipine or placebo over one week. Passive avoidance and novel object recognition (NOR) tasks were performed using shuttle box and NOR test respectively. GRP78/BiP and CHOP levels were measured in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) by western blot technique. The glutathione (GSH) level and PDI activity were also assessed in the hippocampus by colorimetric spectrophotometer. Aβ treated group developed passive avoidance and novel recognition memory deficit compared to the control group. However treatment with calcium channel blockers reversed the impairment. BiP and CHOP level increased in the hippocampus following amyloidopathy in the EC. PDI activity and GSH level in the hippocampus decreased in the Aβ treated group but calcium channel blockers restored them toward the control level. In conclusion memory impairment due to EC amyloidopathy is associated with ER stress related bio-molecular changes in the hippocampus and treatment with L-type calcium channel blockers may prevent the changes and ultimately improve cognitive performance.,NA,"Department of Physiology and Pharmacology Pasteur Institute of Iran Tehran Iran.

However global cholesterol-lowering therapies have yielded mixed results when it comes to slowing down or preventing cognitive decline in AD. We used the transgenic mouse model Cyp27Tg with systemically high levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH) to examine long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 region combined with dendritic spine reconstruction of CA1 pyramidal neurons to detect morphological and functional synaptic alterations induced by 27-OH high levels. Our results show that elevated 27-OH levels lead to enhanced LTP in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. This increase is correlated with abnormally large dendritic spines in the stratum radiatum. Using immunohistochemistry for synaptopodin (actin-binding protein involved in the recruitment of the spine apparatus) we found a significantly higher density of synaptopodin-positive puncta in CA1 in Cyp27Tg mice. We hypothesize that high 27-OH levels alter synaptic potentiation and could lead to dysfunction of fine-tuned processing of information in hippocampal circuits resulting in cognitive impairment. We suggest that these alterations could be detrimental for synaptic function and cognition later in life representing a potential mechanism by which hypercholesterolemia could lead to alterations in memory function in neurodegenerative diseases.,NA,"Department of Neurobiology Care Sciences and Society Division of Neurogeriatrics Center for Alzheimer Research Karolinska Institutet Stockholm Sweden.

Chen;Shayna N. Mason;Diana M. Rigan;Jacquelin F. Kwentus;John M. Hayes;Emily D. Glass;Evan L. Reynolds;Geoffrey G. Murphy;Eva L. Feldman,CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,NA,"Background As the field of stem cell therapy advances, it is important to develop reliable methods to overcome host immune responses in animal models. This ensures survival of transplanted human stem cell grafts and enables predictive efficacy testing. Immunosuppressive drugs derived from clinical protocols are frequently used but are often inconsistent and associated with toxic side effects. Here, using a molecular imaging approach, we show that immunosuppression targeting costimulatory molecules CD4 and CD40L enables robust survival of human xenografts in mouse brain, as compared to conventional tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Methods Human neural stem cells were modified to express green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase. Cells were implanted in the fimbria fornix of the hippocampus and viability assessed by non-invasive bioluminescent imaging. Cell survival was assessed using traditional pharmacologic immunosuppression as compared to monoclonal antibodies directed against CD4 and CD40L. This paradigm was also implemented in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Results Graft rejection occurs within 7 days in non-immunosuppressed mice and within 14 days in mice on a traditional regimen. The addition of dual monoclonal antibody immunosuppression extends graft survival past 7 weeks (p < .001) on initial studies. We confirm dual monoclonal antibody treatment is superior to either antibody alone (p < .001). Finally, we demonstrate robust xenograft survival at multiple cell doses up to 6 months in both C57BL/6J mice and a transgenic Alzheimer's disease model (p < .001). The dual monoclonal antibody protocol demonstrated no significant adverse effects, as determined by complete blood counts and toxicity screen. Conclusions This study demonstrates an effective immunosuppression protocol for preclinical testing of stem cell therapies. A transition towards antibody-based strategies may be advantageous by enabling stem cell survival in preclinical studies that could inform future clinical trials.",NA,NA,2022,10.1002/ctm2.1046,,,,wos:000853271000001,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

Serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) have a critical effect on various regulatory mechanisms involved in synaptic plasticity learning and memory. Okadaic acid (OKA) a potent inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A reportedly leads to cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of OKA on electrophysiological characteristics of hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) neurons in vivo. Male Wistar rats were divided into two control and OKA groups. OKA was injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) into lateral ventricles and after two weeks the long-term potentiation (LTP) and paired-pulse responses recorded from hippocampal perforant path-DG synapses in order to assess short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity. Results of this study revealed that OKA-induced inhibition of PP1 and PP2A activity drastically attenuates the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slope and population spike (PS) amplitude following paired pulse and high frequency stimulation (HFS) of hippocampal DG neurons indicating pre- and post-synaptic involvement in electrical activity of these neurons. Administration of OKA impaired the short-term and long-term spatial memories conducted by Y-maze and passive avoidance tests respectively. OKA-induced attenuation in electrophysiological activity and consequent memory deficits also provide a beneficial tool for studying neurodegenerative disorders such as AD.,NA,"Department of Physiology School of Medicine Ardabil University of Medical Sciences Ardabil Iran.

N ",Front Aging Neurosci,Front Aging Neurosci,Hypertension is recognized as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease but the causal link remains undetermined. Although astrocytes and microglia play an important role in maintaining the neurovascular unit astrocytes and microglia have been understudied in comorbid models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease. In this study male transgenic Fischer 344 rats (TgAPP21) overexpressing a pathogenic human amyloid precursor protein received 8 weeks of Angiotensin II infusion to increase blood pressure and the rats were evaluated for astrocytosis microgliosis and cognitive function. A linear relationship between astrocytosis and blood pressure was observed in the corpus callosum and cingulum of wildtype rats with hypertensive wildtype rats matching the elevated baseline astrocytosis seen in normotensive transgenic rats. In contrast hypertensive transgenic rats did not demonstrate a further increase of astrocytosis suggesting a deficient response. Angiotensin II infusion did not affect activation of microglia which were elevated in the white matter and hippocampus of transgenic rats. Angiotensin II infusion did impair both wildtype and transgenic rats' executive functions in the Morris Water Maze. These results present important implications for the interaction between hypertension and pathogenic human amyloid precursor protein expression as Angiotensin II infusion produced cognitive impairments in both genotypes but transgenic rats were additionally impaired in developing a normal astrocytic response to elevated blood pressure.,NA,"Vulnerable Brain Lab Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry Western University London ON Canada.

C ",Neurobiol Dis,Neurobiol Dis,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative disease. Although neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid beta are classic hallmarks of AD the earliest deficits in AD progression may be caused by unknown factors. One suspected factor has to do with brain energy metabolism. To investigate this factor brain metabolic activity in 3xTg-AD mice and age-matched controls were measured with FDG-PET. Significant hypometabolic changes (p < .01) in brain metabolism were detected in the cortical piriform and insular regions of AD brains relative to controls. These regions are associated with olfaction which is a potential clinical marker for AD progression as well as neurogenesis. The activity of the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex IV) and the expression of complex I-V were significantly decreased (p < .05) suggesting that impaired metabolic activity coupled with impaired oxidative phosphorylation leads to decreased mitochondrial bioenergetics and subsequent Neurodegeneration. Although there is an association between neuroinflammatory pathological markers (microglial) and hypometabolism in AD there was no association found between neuropathological (Aβ tau and astrocytes) and functional changes in AD sensitive brain regions also suggesting that brain hypometabolism occurs prior to AD pathology. Therefore targeting metabolic mechanisms in cortical piriform and insular regions at early stages may be a promising approach for preventing slowing and/or blocking the onset of AD and preserving neurogenesis.,NA,"St. Boniface Hospital Research Canada; Dept. of Pharmacology & Therapeutics University of Manitoba Canada.

M ",Contemporary Clinical Trials,Contemporary Clinical Trials,Lifestyle interventions to increase exercise and improve diet have been the focus of recent clinical trials to potentially prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD). However despite the strong links between sleep disruptions cognitive decline and AD sleep enhancement has yet to be targeted as a lifestyle intervention to prevent AD. A recent meta-analysis suggests that approximately 15% of AD may be prevented by an efficacious intervention aimed to reduce sleep disturbances and sleep disorders. Chronic insomnia is the most frequent sleep disorder occurring in at least 40% of older adults. Individuals with insomnia are more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and demonstrate decline in cognitive function at long-term follow-up. AD is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques and tau tangles in the brain and growing evidence shows impaired sleep contributes to the accumulation of A beta. An intervention aimed at improving insomnia may be a critical opportunity for primary prevention to slow cognitive decline and potentially delay the onset of AD. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is an efficacious treatment for insomnia but the use of CBT-I to improve cognitive function and potentially reduce the rate of A beta accumulation has never been examined. Therefore the objective of the proposed study is to examine the efficacy of CBT-I on improving cognitive function in older adults with symptoms of insomnia. An exploratory aim is to assess the effect of CBT-I on rate of A beta accumulation.,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000599523300018,"[Siengsukon Catherine F.; Nelson Eryen; Williams-Cooke Cierra; Ludwig Rebecca; Beck Eber Silveira Jr.] Univ Kansas Med Ctr Dept Phys Therapy & Rehabil Sci Kansas City KS 66160 USA.

L.Combs C. K ",J Alzheimers Dis,J Alzheimers Dis,BACKGROUND: Although it is known that the brain communicates with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract via the well-established gut-brain axis the influence exerted by chronic intestinal inflammation on brain changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not fully understood. We hypothesized that increased gut inflammation would alter brain pathology of a mouse model of AD. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether colitis exacerbates AD-related brain changes. METHODS: To test this idea 2% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) was dissolved in the drinking water and fed ad libitum to male C57BL/6 wild type and AppNL-G-F mice at 6-10 months of age for two cycles of three days each. DSS is a negatively charged sulfated polysaccharide which results in bloody diarrhea and weight loss changes similar to human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). RESULTS: Both wild type and AppNL-G-F mice developed an IBD-like condition. Brain histologic and biochemical assessments demonstrated increased insoluble Aβ1-40/42 levels along with the decreased microglial CD68 immunoreactivity in DSS treated AppNL-G-F mice compared to vehicle treated AppNL-G-F mice. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that intestinal dysfunction is capable of altering plaque deposition and glial immunoreactivity in the brain.

Urolithin B (UB) one of the major subcategories of urolithins (microbiota metabolites) found in various tissues after ellagitannin consumption has been shown to possess antioxidant anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects. However the neuroprotective effect of UB on brain aging in mice and its potential mechanisms were still unknown. Methods: In the current research we first assessed the ameliorative effects of UB on oxidative injury and apoptosis induced by H(2)O(2) in neuro-2a cells. Then a subcutaneous injection of D-galactose in mice for 8 weeks was used to establish the aging model to evaluate the protective effects of UB. The capacity of memory and learning alterations of hippocampus histology and corresponding molecular mechanisms were all evaluated. Results: The D-gal-induced accelerated aging model in vivo demonstrated that UB could significantly ameliorate deficits in learning and memory by inhibiting the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and elevating the expression and activity of Cu Zn-SOD and CAT. Furthermore UB downregulated the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway and prevented cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria thereby inhibiting neuronal apoptosis during the aging process. More importantly UB stimulation of aging mice activated ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) leading to neuronal survival along with Akt and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and activation. Conclusion: In summary UB effectively alleviated cognitive deficits and ameliorated brain aging-related conditions and could be considered a healthcare product to prevent aging-associated NDs such as AD.,NA,"Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery Ministry of Education Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences Wuhan China.

Hallmarks of AD pathology are amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition forming neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). For many years, AD drug development has mainly focused on directly targeting the Aβ aggregation or the formation of tau tangles, but this disease has no cure so far. Other common characteristics of AD are synaptic abnormalities and dysfunctions such as synaptic damage, synaptic loss, and structural changes in the synapse. Those anomalies happen in the early stages of the disease before behavioural symptoms have occurred. Therefore, better understanding the mechanisms underlying the synaptic dysfunction found in AD and targeting the synapse, especially using early treatment windows, can lead to finding novel and more effective treatments that could improve the lives of AD patients. Researchers have recently started developing different disease-modifying treatments targeting the synapse to rescue and prevent synaptic dysfunction in AD. The main objectives of these new strategies are to halt synaptic loss, strengthen synaptic connections, and improve synaptic density, potentially leading to the rescue or prevention of cognitive impairments. This article aims to address the mechanisms of synaptic degeneration in AD and discuss current strategies that focus on the synapse for AD therapy. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impairs memory and causes cognitive and behavioural deficits. Scientists worldwide have tried to find a treatment that can reverse or rescue AD symptoms, but there is no cure so far. One prominent characteristic of AD is the brain atrophy caused by significant synaptic loss and overall neuronal damage, which starts at the early stages of the disease before other AD hallmarks such as neuritic plaques and NFTs. The present review addresses the underlying mechanisms behind synaptic loss and dysfunction in AD and discusses potential strategies that target the synapse.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35444256,NA,2022,10.1038/s41380-022-01565-z,,,,pubmed-35444256,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b,Laurel Renton,Excluded,Excluded

S ",Front Aging Neurosci,Front Aging Neurosci,Aging is a multifactorial phenomenon that results in several changes at cellular and molecular levels and is considered the main risk factor for some neurodegenerative diseases. Several evidence show the participation of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) in neurodegeneration and this system has been associated with inflammation and immunogenic responses in the central and peripheral systems by the activation of the B1 and B2 receptors. Previous work by our group showed that bradykinin (BK) and the B2 receptor played a possible role in neuroprotection. Therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the participation of B2 receptors in cell viability neuroinflammatory response and neuroplasticity in organotypic hippocampal cultures (OHCs) of 6- and 12-month-old mice. It was observed that activation of the B2 receptor by bradykinin decreased the inflammatory response and increased plasticity in 12-month-old slices. Conversely there was an increase in the inflammatory response and a decrease in neural plasticity in the 6-month-old slices. In both ages an increase in cell viability was observed. This data suggests that the function of the kinin B2 receptor in the hippocampus is modulated by age providing neuroprotective action in old age.,NA,"Department of Physiological Sciences Santa Casa de São Paulo School of Medical Sciences São Paulo Brazil.

It is characterized by progressive deterioration of memory and cognition. Many new potential targets are being investigated to develop effective therapeutic strategies for AD. Neuropeptide S (NPS) is an endogenous peptide in the central nervous system which has been shown to play a beneficial role in learning and memory. However whether NPS can ameliorate cognitive deficits in AD remains unclear. In this study we examined the effects of NPS treatment on the cognitive behaviors and pathological hallmarks in 8-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) AD mice. We found that the APP/PS1 mice exhibited lower levels of NPS receptors (NPSRs) in the hippocampal area and NPS administration increased c-Fos expression in the hippocampus and cortex which suggests the NPS/NPSR system may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. After an intracerebroventricular injection of NPS (1 nmol) for 2 weeks we found NPS treatment ameliorated spatial memory deficits and promoted dendrite ramification and spine generation in hippocampal CA1 neurons which was accompanied by the upregulation of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and synapsin1. We also demonstrated that the injection of NPS decreased Aβ plaque deposits by decreasing the γ-secretase activity and the phosphorylation of APP at Thr668.

WBV has been extensively investigated through clinical studies with main focus on the musculoskeletal system. However, pre-clinical data in the context of behavior, memory and motor functions with aged rodents are limited. The aim of this experiment was to investigate the dose dependent effects of a five weeks long WBV intervention with an aged animal model including anxiety-related behavior, memory and motor functions, as well as markers of (neuro)inflammation. Male Wistar rats (18 months) underwent 5 or 20 min daily vibration exposure or pseudo-treatment (i.e.: being subjected to the same environmental stimuli for 5 or 20 min, but without exposure to vibrations) 5 times per week. After 5 weeks treatment, cognitive functions, anxiety-like behavior and motor performance were evaluated. Finally, brain tissue was collected for immunohistological purposes to evaluate hippocampal (neuro)inflammation. Animals with 20 min daily session of WBV showed a decrease in their anxiety-like behavior and improvement in their spatial memory. Muscle strength in the grip hanging test was only significantly improved by 5 min daily WBV treatments, whereas motor coordination in the balance beam test was not significantly altered. Microglia activation showed a significant decrease in the CA1 and Dentate gyrus subregions by both dose of WBV. In contrast, these effects were less pronounced in the CA3 and Hilus subregions, where only 5 min dose showed a significant effect on microglia activation. Our results indicate, that WBV seems to be a comparable strategy on age-related anxiety, cognitive and motor decline, as well as alleviating age-related (neuro)inflammation.",NA,Semmelweis Egyetem|Rijksuniversiteit Groningen|Universitair Medisch Centrum Groningen|Hungarian University of Sports Science,2022,10.1038/s41598-022-13178-1,,,,scopus-2-s2.0-85130949809,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

Drp1 activation via S616 phosphorylation rescues deficits of spine maturation in Pink1 KO neurons. Notably, mice harboring a knockin (KI) phosphor-null Drp1S616A recapitulate spine immaturity and synaptic abnormality identified in Pink1 KO mice. Chemical LTP (cLTP) induces Drp1S616 phosphorylation in a PINK1-dependent manner. Moreover, phosphor-mimetic Drp1S616D restores reduced dendritic spine localization of mitochondria in Pink1 KO neurons.

Long-Evans male rats were injected with the cholinergic immunotoxin 192 IgG-saporin into the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (0.37 µg); vehicle injections served as controls. Immediately after surgery, OTR4132 was injected into the lateral ventricles (0.25 µg/5 µl/rat) or intramuscularly (1.5 mg/kg). To determine whether OTR4132 reached the lesion site, some rats received intracerebroventricular (ICV) or intramuscular (I.M.) injections of fluorescent OTR4132. Rats were sacrificed at 4, 10, 20, or 60 days post-lesion (DPL). Fluorescein-labeled OTR4132 injected ICV or I.M. was found in the lesion from 4 to 20 DPL. Rats with partial hippocampal cholinergic denervation showed decreases in hippocampal acetylcholinesterase reaction products and in choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons in the medial septum. These lesions were the largest at 10 DPL and then remained stable until 60 DPL. Both hippocampal acetylcholinesterase reaction products and choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons in the medial septum effects were significantly attenuated in OTR4132-treated rats. These effects were not related to competition between OTR4132 and 192 IgG-saporin for the neurotrophin receptor P75 (p75 NTR ), as OTR4132 treatment did not alter the internalization of Cy3-labelled 192 IgG. OTR4132 was more efficient at reducing the acetylcholinesterase reaction products and choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons than a comparable heparin dose used as a comparator. Using the slice superfusion technique, we found that the lesion-induced decrease in muscarinic autoreceptor sensitivity was abolished by intramuscular OTR4132. After partial cholinergic damage, OTR4132 was able to concentrate at the brain lesion site possibly due to the disruption of the blood-brain barrier and to exert structural and functional effects that hold promises for neuroprotection/neurotrophism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35254602,NA,2022,10.1007/s10719-022-10047-x,,,,pubmed-35254602,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b,Laurel Renton,Excluded,Excluded

J.Wehr M ",Neurobiology of Aging,Neurobiology of Aging,Early detection will be crucial for effective treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease. The identification and validation of early noninvasive biomarkers is therefore key to avoiding the most devastating aspects of Alzheimer's disease. Measures of central auditory processing such as gap detection have recently emerged as potential biomarkers in both human patients and the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Full validation of gap detection deficits as a biomarker will require detailed understanding of the underlying neuropathology including which brain structures are involved and how the operation of neural circuits is affected. Here we show that 5XFAD mice exhibit gap detection deficits as early as 2 months of age well before development of Alzheimer's disease-associated pathology. We then examined responses of neurons in the auditory cortex to gaps in white noise. Both gap responses and baseline firing rates were robustly and progressively degraded in 5XFAD mice compared to litter mate controls. These impairments were first evident at 2-4 months of age in males and 4-6 months in females. This demonstrates early-onset impairments to the central auditory system which could be due to damage in the auditory cortex upstream subcortical structures or both. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Persistent low-grade inflammation may contribute to DR. Increased salt intake has been shown to promote autoimmunity in the brain. This study determined the role of salt intake in DR development. Methods: Eight-week-old C57BL/6 J male mice received streptozotocin to induce diabetes. Diabetic or non-diabetic mice were fed a diet containing normal, low and high amounts of salt. The retinal function, structure and inflammatory response were determined 8 weeks after the establishment of diabetes. Interleukin (IL)-1β or a NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inhibitor was injected intravitreally and the retinal changes were evaluated. Results: A high salt diet worsened the functional and structural damage of retinal cells and increased IL-1β in the retina of diabetic mice. IL-1β injection impaired the function of photoreceptors and retinal structure in the diabetic mice. Blocking NLRP3 inhibited IL-1β increase in the mouse bone marrow macrophages cultured in high sodium medium. NLRP3 inhibition attenuated retinal injury of diabetic mice on high salt diet. A low-salt diet also triggered inflammation and cell damage in the retina of diabetic mice but at a lower grade than those induced by high salt diet. A low or high salt diet for 8 weeks did not induce inflammation or cell injury in the retina of mice without diabetes. Conclusion: These results indicate that high salt intake has deleterious effects in DR development through NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the subsequent production of IL-1β.

P ",Aging Cell,Aging Cell,Age-related cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the deficits of synaptic plasticity. Therefore exploring promising targets to enhance synaptic plasticity in neurodegenerative disorders is crucial. It has been demonstrated that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) plays a vital role in neuronal development and MeCP2 malfunction causes various neurodevelopmental disorders. However the role of MeCP2 in neurodegenerative diseases has been less reported. In the study we found that MeCP2 expression in the hippocampus was reduced in the hippocampus of senescence-accelerated mice P8 (SAMP8) mice. Overexpression of hippocampal MeCP2 could elevate synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in SAMP8 mice while knockdown of MeCP2 impaired synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in senescence accelerated-resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice. MeCP2-mediated regulation of synaptic plasticity may be associated with CREB1 pathway. These results suggest that MeCP2 plays a vital role in age-related cognitive decline by regulating synaptic plasticity and indicate that MeCP2 may be promising targets for the treatment of age-related cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases.,NA,"Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy Pharmacy School of Xuzhou Medical University Xuzhou China.

However increasing data is suggesting that brain network alterations rather than protein deposition could account for the early pathogenesis of the disease. In the present study we performed in vitro extracellular field recordings in the CA1/subiculum area of the hippocampus from 30 days old J20-TG-AD mice. Here we found that theta oscillations were significantly less rhythmic than those recorded from control group. In addition J20 mice displayed significantly less theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling (CFC) as peak modulation indexes for slow (25-45 Hz) and fast (150-250 Hz) gamma frequency oscillations were reduced. Because inhibitory parvalbumin (PV) cells play a vital role in coordinating hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and extracellular stimulation were performed to access their intrinsic and synaptic properties. Whereas neither the inhibitory output of local interneurons to pyramidal cells (PCs) (inhibitory→PC) nor the excitatory output of PCs to PV cells (PC→PV) differed between control and J20 animals the intrinsic excitability of PV cells was reduced in J20 mice compared to controls. Interestingly optogenetic activation of PV interneurons which can directly drive theta oscillations in the hippocampus did not rescue CFC impairments suggesting the latter did not simply result from alteration of the underlying theta rhythm. Altered young J20 mice was characterized by the presence of β-CTF but not with Aβ accumulation in the hippocampus. Importantly the β secretase inhibitor AZD3839-AstraZeneca significantly rescued the abnormal early electrophysiological phenotype of J20 mice. In conclusion our data show that brain network alterations precede the canonical Aβ protein deposition and that such alterations can be related to β-CTF fragment.,NA,"Department of Psychiatry Douglas Mental Health University Institute McGill University Montreal QC Canada.

Surprisingly however cognitive functions are improved in AD models after ablating adult neural stem cells (aNSCs). Ablation of aNSCs does not affect the levels of amyloid β but restores the normal synaptic transmission in the dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells of AD models. Furthermore calbindin depletion in the DG of AD mice is ameliorated after aNSC ablation and knocking down calbindin abolishes the effects of aNSC ablation on synaptic and cognitive functions of AD mice. Together our data suggest that cognitive functions of AD mice are improved after aNSC ablation which is associated with the restoration of synaptic transmission in the DG granule cells with calbindin as an important mediator.,NA,"Department of Neurobiology and Department of Neurology of the First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou Zhejiang Province 310058 China; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology Medical School of Ningbo University Ningbo Zhejiang Province 315211 China.

In the human cortex however direct experimental evidence for coordinated structural and functional synaptic adaptation is currently lacking. Here we probed synaptic plasticity in human cortical slices using the vitamin A derivative all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) a putative treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Our experiments demonstrated that the excitatory synapses of superficial (layer 2/3) pyramidal neurons underwent coordinated structural and functional changes in the presence of atRA. These synaptic adaptations were accompanied by ultrastructural remodeling of the calcium-storing spine apparatus organelle and required mRNA translation. It was not observed in synaptopodin-deficient mice which lack spine apparatus organelles. We conclude that atRA is a potent mediator of synaptic plasticity in the adult human cortex.
The brain has an enormous capacity to adapt to its environment. This ability to continuously learn and form new memories thanks to its malleability is known as brain plasticity. One of the most important mechanisms behind brain plasticity is the change in both the structure and function of synapses the points of contact between neurons where communication happens. These sites of synaptic contact occur through microscopic protrusions on the branches of neurons called dendritic spines. Dendritic spines are very dynamic changing their shape and size in response to stimuli. Previous studies have shown that alterations in synaptic plasticity occur in various animal models of brain diseases. However it remains unclear whether human cortical neurons express synaptic plasticity similarly to those in the rodent brain. Recently a derivative of vitamin A has been linked to synaptic plasticity. In addition several studies have evaluated the effects of this derivative in patients with cognitive dysfunctions including Alzheimer’s disease Fragile X syndrome and depression. However there is no direct experimental evidence for synaptic plasticity in the adult human cerebral cortex related to vitamin A signaling and metabolism. To investigate this Lenz et al. used human cortical slices prepared from neurosurgical resections and treated them with a solution of the vitamin A derivative all-trans retinoic acid for 6-10 hours. Lenz et al. employed a variety of techniques including patch-clamp recordings to measure neuron function as well as different types of microscopy to evaluate structural changes in dendritic spines. These experiments demonstrated that the derivative promoted the synaptic plasticity in the adult human cortex. Specifically it increased the size of the dendritic spines and strengthened their ability to transmit signals. In addition Lenz et al. found that the spine apparatus organelle – a structure found in some dendritic spines – was a target of the vitamin A derivative and promoted synaptic plasticity. These findings advance the understanding of the pathways through which vitamin A derivatives affect synaptic plasticity which may aide the development of new therapeutic strategies for brain diseases. More generally the results contribute to the identification of key mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in the adult human brain.

A.Degan S.Hoffmann U.Galeffi F.Colton C. A ",Alzheimers Dement,Alzheimers Dement,We compared the efficacy of neurovascular coupling and substrate supply in cerebral cortex during severe metabolic challenges in transgenic Alzheimer's [CVN-AD] and control [C57Bl/6] mice to evaluate the hypothesis that metabolic insufficiency is a critical component of degeneration leading to dementia. We analyzed cerebral blood flow and metabolic responses to spreading depression (induced by K(+) applied to the cortex) and anoxia across aging in CVN-AD + C57Bl/6 genotypes. In the CVN-AD genotype progression to histological and cognitive hallmarks of dementia is a stereotyped function of age. We correlated physiology and imaging of the cortex with the blood flow responses measured with laser doppler probes. The results show that spreading depression resulted in a hyperemic blood flow response that was dramatically reduced (24% in amplitude 70% in area) in both middle-aged and aged CVN-AD mice compared to C57Bl/6 age-matched controls. However spreading depression amplitude and conduction velocity (≈6 mm/min) did not differ among groups. Anoxia (100% N(2) ) showed significantly decreased (by 62%) reactive blood flow and autoregulation in aged AD-CVN mice compared to aged control animals. Significantly reduced neurovascular coupling occurred prematurely with aging in CVN-AD mice. Abbreviated physiological hyperemia and decreased resilience to anoxia may enhance early-onset metabolic deficiency through decreased substrate supply to the brain. Metabolic deficiency may contribute significantly to the degeneration associated with dementia as a function of aging and regions of the brain involved.,NA,"Neurosurgery Box 3807 Duke University Medical Center Durham North Carolina 27710 USA.

M ",Handb Exp Pharmacol,Handb Exp Pharmacol,The cellular processes regulated by WNT signaling have been mainly studied during embryonic development and cancer. In the last two decades the role of WNT in the adult central nervous system has been the focus of interest in our laboratory. In this chapter we will be summarized β-catenin-dependent and -independent WNT pathways then we will be revised WNT signaling function at the pre- and post-synaptic level. Concerning Alzheimer's disease (AD) initially we found that WNT/β-catenin signaling activation exerts a neuroprotective mechanism against the amyloid β (Αβ) peptide toxicity. Later we found that WNT/β-catenin participates in Tau phosphorylation and in learning and memory. In the last years we demonstrated that WNT/β-catenin signaling is instrumental in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and that WNT/β-catenin dysfunction results in Aβ production and aggregation. We highlight the importance of WNT/β-catenin signaling dysfunction in the onset of AD and propose that the loss of WNT/β-catenin signaling is a triggering factor of AD. The WNT pathway is therefore positioned as a therapeutic target for AD and could be a valid concept for improving AD therapy. We think that metabolism and inflammation will be relevant when defining future research in the context of WNT signaling and the neurodegeneration associated with AD.,NA,"Centro de Envejecimiento y Regeneración (CARE UC) Departamento de Biología Celular y Molecular Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile Santiago Chile. ninestrosa@bio.puc.cl.

Mutations in RyR2 are associated with both cardiac arrhythmias and intellectual disability. While the mechanisms of RyR2-linked arrhythmias are well characterized, little is known about the mechanism underlying RyR2-associated intellectual disability. Here, we employed a mouse model expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged RyR2 and a specific GFP probe to determine the subcellular localization of RyR2 in hippocampus. GFP-RyR2 was predominantly detected in the soma and dendrites, but not the dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons or dentate gyrus granular neurons. GFP-RyR2 was also detected within the mossy fibers in the stratum lucidum of CA3, but not in the presynaptic terminals of CA1 neurons. An arrhythmogenic RyR2-R4496C+/− mutation downregulated the A-type K+ current and increased membrane excitability, but had little effect on the afterhyperpolarization current or presynaptic facilitation of CA1 neurons. The RyR2-R4496C+/− mutation also impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation, learning, and memory.

W.Gyengesi E.Buskila Y ",Brain Struct Funct,Brain Struct Funct,The medial septal nucleus is one of the basal forebrain nuclei that projects cholinergic input to the hippocampus and cortex. Two of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are a significant loss of cholinergic transmission and neuroinflammation and it has been suggested that these two hallmarks are causally linked to the medial septum. Therefore we have investigated the age-related susceptibility of medial septal cholinergic neurons to glial activation mediated via peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide (500 μg/kg) into ChAT(BAC)-eGFP mice at different ages (3-22 months). Our results show that during normal aging cholinergic neurons experience a bi-phasic excitability profile in which increased excitability at adulthood (ages ranging between 9 and 12 months) decreases in aged animals (> 18 months). Moreover activation of glia had a differential impact on mice from different age groups affecting K(+) conductances in young and adult animals without affecting aged mice. These findings provide a potential explanation for the increased vulnerability of cholinergic neurons to neuroinflammation with aging as reported previously thus providing a link to the impact of acute neuroinflammation in AD.,NA,"School of Medicine Western Sydney University Campbelltown NSW 2560 Australia.

W.Maezawa I ",Glia,Glia,Microglia show a rich repertoire of activation patterns regulated by a complex ensemble of surface ion channels receptors and transporters. We and others have investigated whether microglia vary their K(+) channel expression as a means to achieve functional diversity. However most of the prior studies were conducted using in vitro models such as BV2 cells primary microglia or brain slices in culture which may not accurately reflect microglia physiology in adult individuals. Here we employed an in vivo mouse model of selective innate immune activation by intracerebroventricular injection of lipopolysaccharides (ICV-LPS) to determine the role of the voltage-gated Kv1.3 channel in LPS-induced M1-like microglial activation. Using microglia acutely isolated from adult brains we detected Kv1.3 and Kir2.1 currents and found that ICV-LPS increased the current density and RNA expression of Kv1.3 but did not affect those of Kir2.1. Genetic knockout of Kv1.3 abolished LPS-induced microglial activation exemplified by Iba-1 immunoreactivity and expression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β TNF-α IL-6 and iNOS. Moreover Kv1.3 knockout mitigated the LPS-induced impairment of hippocampal long-term potentiation (hLTP) suggesting that Kv1.3 activity regulates pro-inflammatory microglial neurotoxicity. Pharmacological intervention using PAP-1 a small molecule that selectively blocks homotetrameric Kv1.3 channels achieved anti-inflammatory and hLTP-recovery effects similar to Kv1.3 knockout. We conclude that Kv1.3 is required for microglial M1-like pro-inflammatory activation in vivo. A significant implication of our in vivo data is that Kv1.3 blockers could be therapeutic candidates for neurological diseases where microglia-mediated neurotoxicity is implicated in the pathogenesis.,NA,"From the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and M.I.N.D.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes are positively associated with the development of premature cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease linking diet with these conditions. Here we demonstrate that in mice episodic memory together with spatial and contextual associative memory is compromised after only one day of high-fat diet. However object memory remains intact. This shows not only a more rapid effect than previously reported but also that more complex memories are at higher risk of being compromised by a high-fat diet. In addition we show that these memory deficits are rapidly reversed by switching mice from a high-fat diet back to a low-fat diet.

Here we analysed whether this occurs in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with impaired LTP induction. We found that a brief 30 min restraint stress protocol reversed the impaired LTP assessed with field excitatory postsynaptic potential recordings at cornu ammonis 3-1 (CA3-CA1) synapses in both Tg2576 and 5XFAD mice. This effect was accompanied by increased phosphorylation and surface expression of glutamate A1 (GluA1) -containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs). Moreover enhanced LTP induction and GluA1 phosphorylation were sustained up to 4 h after the stress. Treatment with 200 nM dexamethasone produced similar effects in the hippocampi of these mice which supports the glucocorticoid receptor-mediated mechanism in these models. Collectively our results demonstrated an alleviation of impaired LTP and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 region following acute stress in the AD mouse models.,NA,"NeuroMedical Convergence Lab Biomedical Research Institute Chonnam National University Hospital Jebong-ro Gwangju 501-757 Republic of Korea.

W.Namkoong K.Kim E ",Psychiatry Investig,Psychiatry Investig,OBJECTIVE: Conventional methods for organotypic hippocampal tissue slice culture (OHSC) have shown several disadvantages or limitations regarding age of animals used duration of culture and difficulty using neurodegenerative models. Therefore we tried to establish OHSC from old 3xTg-Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice for longer period (over 4 weeks) and to validate utility of this system as a valid platform for translational neuroscience of AD. METHODS: OHSC was performed with old 3xTg-AD mice (12-14 months) old wild type mice (12-14 months) and young 3xTg-AD mice (2-4 months) using serum-free medium for 4 weeks. Hippocampal structure was evaluated by 4' 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) intensity and neuronal metabolism was measured by Alamarblue assay. Pathologic characteristics of AD were also investigated; β-amyloid levels by ELISA amyloid plaque deposition by Thioflavin-S staining and glial activation by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Following 4-week culture in serum-free media hippocampal cells and layers were well preserved in cultured slices from old AD mice as was in those from young AD and old wild type mice. On the contrary excessive regression of total visible cells was observed in conventional serum-containing medium regardless of genotype of mice. In parallel with this well preserved structure major pathologic characteristics of AD were also well manifested in hippocampal slices from old AD mice. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that long-term OHSC from old 3xTg-AD mouse can serve as a promising ex vivo system for studies on pathophysiology of AD especially with the minimum number of sacrifice of experimental animals.,NA,"Department of Psychiatry Yonsei University College of Medicine Seoul Republic of Korea.

R ",ASN Neuro,ASN Neuro,Alzheimer’s disease (AD) ranks sixth on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Top 10 Leading Causes of Death list for 2016 and the Alzheimer’s Association attributes 60% to 80% of dementia cases as AD related. AD pathology hallmarks include accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles; however evidence supports that soluble amyloid beta (Aβ) rather than insoluble plaques may instigate synaptic failure. Soluble Aβ accumulation results in depression of long-term potentiation leading to cognitive deficits commonly characterized in AD. The mechanisms through which Aβ incites cognitive decline have been extensively explored with a growing body of evidence pointing to modulation of the glutamatergic system. The period of glutamatergic hypoactivation observed alongside long-term potentiation depression and cognitive deficits in later disease stages may be the consequence of a preceding period of increased glutamatergic activity. This review will explore the Aβ-related changes to the tripartite glutamate synapse resulting in altered cell signaling throughout disease progression ultimately culminating in oxidative stress synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss.,NA,"1 Department of Neurology Center for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Neuroscience Institute Southern Illinois University School of Medicine Springfield IL USA.

Our data demonstrate that both combination treatment and monotherapy attenuated brain Aβ and improved the nesting behavioral deficit to varying degrees. Importantly, the combination treatment group had the lowest Aβ levels, and insoluble forms of Aβ were reduced most effectively. The nesting performance of APP/PS1 mice receiving combination treatment was better than that of other APP/PS1 groups. Further findings indicate that enhanced microglial Aβ phagocytosis and lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines were concurrent with the aforementioned effects of NP106 in combination with TML-6. Intriguingly, combination treatment also normalized the gut microbiota of APP/PS1 mice to levels resembling the wild-type control.

The aim of this study was to study the long-term brain distribution of two radiolabeled monoclonal A beta antibody variants - RmAb158 the recombinant murine version of BAN2401 which has recently demonstrated amyloid removal and reduced cognitive decline in AD patients and the bispecific RmAb158-scFv8D3 which has been engineered for enhanced brain uptake via transferrin receptor-mediated transcytosis. Methods A single intravenous injection of iodine-125 (I-125)-labeled RmAb158-scFv8D3 or RmAb158 was administered to AD transgenic mice (tg-ArcSwe). In vivo single-photon emission computed tomography was used to investigate brain retention and intrabrain distribution of the antibodies over a period of 4 weeks. Activity in blood and brain tissue was measured ex vivo and autoradiography was performed in combination with A beta and CD31 immunostaining to investigate the intrabrain distribution of the antibodies and their interactions with A beta. Results Despite faster blood clearance [I-125]RmAb158-scFv8D3 displayed higher brain exposure than [I-125]RmAb158 throughout the study. The brain distribution of [I-125]RmAb158-scFv8D3 was more uniform and coincided with parenchymal A beta pathology while [I-125]RmAb158 displayed a more scattered distribution pattern and accumulated in central parts of the brain at later times. Ex vivo autoradiography indicated greater vascular escape and parenchymal A beta interactions for [I-125]RmAb158-scFv8D3 whereas [I-125]RmAb158 displayed retention and A beta interactions in lateral ventricles. Conclusions The high brain uptake and uniform intrabrain distribution of RmAb158-scFv8D3 highlight the benefits of receptor-mediated transcytosis for antibody-based brain imaging. Moreover it suggests that the alternative transport route of the bispecific antibody contributes to improved efficacy of brain-directed immunotherapy.,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000574243200002,"[Gustavsson Tobias; Syvanen Stina; Sehlin Dag] Uppsala Univ Dept Publ Hlth & Caring Sci Uppsala Sweden.

However, a majority of studies focus on the individual pathologies and seldom on the interaction between the two pathologies. Herein, we present the longitudinal neuropathological and neurophysiological effects of a combined amyloid-tau model by hippocampal seeding of human-derived tau pathology in the APP.PS1/L166P amyloid animal model. We statistically assessed both neurophysiological and pathological changes using linear mixed modelling to determine if factors such as the age at which animals were seeded, genotype, seeding or buffer, brain region where pathology was quantified, and time-post injection differentially affect these outcomes. We report that AT8-positive tau pathology progressively develops and is facilitated by the amount of amyloid pathology present at the time of injection. The amount of AT8-positive tau pathology was influenced by the interaction of age at which the animal was injected, genotype, and time after injection. Baseline pathology-related power spectra and Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD) score alterations were noted in APP.PS1/L166P before any manipulations were performed, indicating a baseline difference associated with genotype. We also report immediate localized hippocampal dysfunction in the electroencephalography (EEG) power spectra associated with tau seeding which returned to comparable levels at 1 month-post-injection. Longitudinal effects of seeding indicated that tau-seeded wild-type mice showed an increase in gamma power earlier than buffer control comparisons which was influenced by the age at which the animal was injected. A reduction of hippocampal broadband power spectra was noted in tau-seeded wild-type mice, but absent in APP.PS1 animals. HFD scores appeared to detect subtle effects associated with tau seeding in APP.PS1 animals, which was differentially influenced by genotype. Notably, while tau histopathological changes were present, a lack of overt longitudinal electrophysiological alterations was noted, particularly in APP.PS1 animals that feature both pathologies after seeding, reiterating and underscoring the difficulty and complexity associated with elucidating physiologically relevant and translatable biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease at the early stages of the disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35546164,NA,2022,10.1038/s41598-022-11582-1,,,,pubmed-35546164,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b,Laurel Renton,Excluded,Excluded

Changes in hippocampal function seem critical for cognitive impairment in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Diffusible oligomers of Aβ (oAβ) have been shown to block canonical long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 area of hippocampus, but whether there is also a direct effect of oAβ on synaptic transmission and plasticity at synapses between mossy fibers (axons) from the dentate gyrus granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons (mf-CA3 synapses) is unknown. Studies in APP transgenic mice have suggested an age-dependent impairment of mossy fiber LTP. Here we report that although endogenous AD brain-derived soluble oAβ had no effect on mossy-fiber basal transmission, it strongly impaired paired-pulse facilitation in the mossy fiber pathway and presynaptic mossy fiber LTP (mf-LTP). Selective activation of both β1 and β2 adrenergic receptors and their downstream cAMP/PKA signaling pathway prevented oAβ-mediated inhibition of mf-LTP. Unexpectedly, activation of the cGMP/PKG signaling pathway also prevented oAβ-impaired mf-LTP.

E ",Mol Psychiatry,Mol Psychiatry,Integrative gene network approaches enable new avenues of exploration that implicate causal genes in sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) pathogenesis thereby offering novel insights for drug-discovery programs. We previously constructed a probabilistic causal network model of sporadic LOAD and identified TYROBP/DAP12 encoding a microglial transmembrane signaling polypeptide and direct adapter of TREM2 as the most robust key driver gene in the network. Here we show that absence of TYROBP/DAP12 in a mouse model of AD-type cerebral Aβ amyloidosis (APP(KM670/671NL)/PSEN1(Δexon9)) recapitulates the expected network characteristics by normalizing the transcriptome of APP/PSEN1 mice and repressing the induction of genes involved in the switch from homeostatic microglia to disease-associated microglia (DAM) including Trem2 complement (C1qa C1qb C1qc and Itgax) Clec7a and Cst7. Importantly we show that constitutive absence of TYROBP/DAP12 in the amyloidosis mouse model prevented appearance of the electrophysiological and learning behavior alterations associated with the phenotype of APP(KM670/671NL)/PSEN1(Δexon9) mice. Our results suggest that TYROBP/DAP12 could represent a novel therapeutic target to slow arrest or prevent the development of sporadic LOAD. These data establish that the network pathology observed in postmortem human LOAD brain can be faithfully recapitulated in the brain of a genetically manipulated mouse. These data also validate our multiscale gene networks by demonstrating how the networks intersect with the standard neuropathological features of LOAD.,NA,"Department of Neurology Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai New York NY 10029 USA.

Yet, the underlying patho-mechanisms remain unknown and treatments limited. To better understand the molecular changes associated with AD, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of candidate genes linked to the disease, like the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA1. However, demonstration of whether and how these genes cause pathology is largely lacking. Here, utilising fly genetics, we generated the first Drosophila model of human wild-type and P460L mutant EphA1 and tested the effects of Eph/ephrin signalling on AD-relevant behaviour and neurophysiology. We show that EphA1 mis-expression did not cause neurodegeneration, shorten lifespan or affect memory but flies mis-expressing the wild-type or mutant receptor were hyper-aroused, had reduced sleep, a stronger circadian rhythm and increased clock neuron activity and excitability. Over-expression of endogenous fly Eph and RNAi-mediated knock-down of Eph and its ligand ephrin affected sleep architecture and neurophysiology. Eph over-expression led to stronger circadian morning anticipation while ephrin knock-down impaired memory. A dominant negative form of the GTPase Rho1, a potential intracellular effector of Eph, led to hyper-aroused flies, memory impairment, less anticipatory behaviour and neurophysiological changes. Our results demonstrate a role of Eph/ephrin signalling in a range of behaviours affected in AD. This presents a starting point for studies into the underlying mechanisms of AD including interactions with other AD-associated genes, like Rho1, Ankyrin, Tau and APP with the potential to identify new targets for treatment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35569721,NA,2022,10.1016/j.nbd.2022.105752,,,,pubmed-35569721,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

We show that microglia adopt a reactive morphology in spinal cords of SMA mice. Ablating lymphocytes did not alter the reactive morphology of SMA microglia and did not improve the survival or motor function of SMA mice, indicating limited impact of peripheral immune cells on the SMA phenotype. We found iPSC-derived SMA microglia adopted an amoeboid morphology and displayed a reactive transcriptome profile, increased cell migration, and enhanced phagocytic activity. Importantly, cell morphology and electrophysiological properties of motor neurons were altered when they were incubated with conditioned media from SMA microglia.

Y.Koh Y. H.Kim J.Koo J. W.We Y. M.Hoe H. S ",Front Mol Neurosci,Front Mol Neurosci,Recently we reported that ALWPs which we developed by combining Liuwei Dihuang pills (LWPs) with antler regulate the LPS-induced neuroinflammatory response and rescue LPS-induced short- and long-term memory impairment in wild-type (WT) mice. In the present study we examined the effects of ALWPs on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and cognitive function in WT mice as well as 5x FAD mice (a mouse model of AD). We found that administration of ALWPs significantly reduced amyloid plaque levels in 5x FAD mice and significantly decreased amyloid β (Aβ) levels in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-overexpressing H4 cells. In addition ALWPs administration significantly suppressed tau hyperphosphorylation in 5x FAD mice. Oral administration of ALWPs significantly improved long-term memory in scopolamine (SCO)-injected WT mice and 5x FAD mice by altering dendritic spine density. Importantly ALWPs promoted spinogenesis in primary hippocampal neurons and WT mice and modulated the dendritic spine number in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner. Taken together our results suggest that ALWPs are a candidate therapeutic drug for AD that can modulate amyloid plaque load tau phosphorylation and synaptic/cognitive function.,NA,"Department of Neural Development and Disease Korea Brain Research Institute (KBRI) Daegu South Korea.

J.Matei N.Liu K.Park J.Shahidi M ",Documenta Ophthalmologica,Documenta Ophthalmologica,Purpose Common characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are observed in 5xFAD transgenic mice at a relatively young age. Retinal dysfunction has been studied in young 5xFAD mice using the electroretinogram (ERG) which has shown amplitude losses and timing delays similar to those observed in older wild type (WT) mice. The purpose of this study was to compare the full-field ERG of young 5xFAD mice to agesimilar WT mice and to older WT mice to determine the extent to which 5xFAD mutations mimic normal aging. Methods Dark-adapted (DA) and light-adapted (LA) flash ERGs were recorded from 22 5xFAD mice at 3 months of age 13 WT mice at 3 months of age (WT3) and 15 WT mice at 9 months of age (WT9). ERGs were recorded in response to achromatic flashes of 0.01 to 25 cd s/m2. Following 2 h of dark adaptation scotopic responses were measured in the dark. Photopic responses were measured against a 30 cd/m2 adapting field after 10 min of light adaptation. Amplitude and implicit time (IT) of the a- and b-waves were calculated according to convention. Oscillatory potentials (OPs) were extracted by bandpass filtering; the amplitude and IT of the OPs were summed to provide a single measure of OP amplitude and IT. In addition the amplitude and IT of the photopic negative response (PhNR) was measured from the light-adapted recordings. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance and Holm-Sidak pairwise comparisons were used to compare the amplitudes and ITs of the 5xFAD mice and the two WT groups. Results There were significant differences between the WT3 and WT9 groups in outer- and inner-retina function under DA conditions: a-wave b-wave and OP amplitude differed (all t>2.98 p<0.02) but IT did not (all t<1.31 p>0.19). DA outer-retinal function did not differ between the 5xFAD and WT3 groups (a-wave amplitude: t = 1.48 p = 0.15) but innerretinal responses differed (b-wave amplitude: t = 3.56 p = 0.002; OP IT: t = 3.71 p = 0.001). Similar patterns were observed under LA conditions: the WT3 and WT9 a-wave b-wave and PhNR amplitudes differed (all t>3.34 p<0.006); there were no significant IT differences (all t<2.24 p>0.05). LA outer-retina function did not differ between the 5xFAD and WT3 groups (a-wave amplitude: t = 1.87 p= 0.13) but inner-retina responses differed (OP amplitude: t = 3.56 p = 0.002; PhNR amplitude t = 5.50 p<0.001). Conclusion Age and AD affect the ERG but the pattern of abnormality is not the same. Older WT mice have reduced photoreceptor function as evidenced by a-wave amplitude reduction which affects the downstream bipolar and retinal ganglion cell responses. In contrast young 5xFAD mice have retinal abnormalities that appear to be selective for the middle/ inner retina. Thus the 5xFAD mouse model does not represent 'premature aging' of the neural retina but rather specific effects of AD on post-receptor function..,https://www.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&AN=634251518https://ed.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44UOE_INST/44UOE_INST:44UOE_VU2?sid=OVID:embase&id=pmid:&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs10633-020-09789-6&issn=1573-2622&isbn=&volume=141&issue=SUPPL+1&spage=S36&pages=S36&date=2020&title=Documenta+Ophthalmologica&atitle=Electrophysiological+abnormalities+in+the+5xFAD+mouse+model+of+Alzheimer%27s+disease%3A+Comparison+to+normal+aging&aulast=McAnany,"(McAnany Liu Park) Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences University of Illinois at Chicago Chicago United States (Matei Shahidi) Department of Ophthalmology University of Southern California Los Angeles CA United StatesJ.J.

HTT mutation causes protein misfolding and aggregation, preferentially affecting medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the basal ganglia. Transcriptional perturbations in synaptic genes and neuroinflammation are key processes that precede MSN dysfunction and motor symptom onset. Understanding the interplay between these processes is crucial to develop effective therapeutic strategies to treat HD. We investigated the role of protein kinase CK2α’, a kinase upregulated in MSNs in HD and previously associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD), in the regulation of neuroinflammation and synaptic function in HD. We used the heterozygous knock-in zQ175 HD mouse model and compared that to zQ175 mice lacking one allele of CK2α’ (zQ175:CK2α’(±)). CK2α’ haploinsufficiency in zQ175 mice resulted in decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, HTT aggregation, astrogliosis and transcriptional alterations of synaptic genes related to glutamatergic signaling. zQ175:CK2α’(±) mice also presented increased frequency of striatal miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), an indicator of synaptic activity, and improved motor coordination compared to zQ175 mice. Neuropathological and phenotypic changes mediated by CK2α’ were connected to alpha-synuclein (α-syn) dysregulation and correlated with differences in α-syn serine 129 phosphorylation (pS129-α-syn), a post-translational modification involved in α-synucleinopathy and shown to be regulated by CK2 in PD. pS129-α-syn was increased in the nuclei of MSNs in zQ175 mice and in the striatum of patients with HD, and it decreased in zQ175:CK2α’(±) mice. Collectively, our data established a novel connection between CK2α’, neuroinflammation and synaptic gene dysregulation with synucleinopathy in HD and suggested common molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration between HD and PD. Our results also support CK2α’ inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy to modulate neuronal function and neuroprotection in HD.",NA,Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias|CIBER Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas|Università degli Studi di Cagliari|University of Minnesota Twin Cities|CSIC-UAM - Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBM)|University of Minnesota Medical School|Universidad de Oviedo|Mepsgen Co.

Unlike advanced AD, the initial steps of AD pathophysiology have been poorly investigated, partially due to limited availability of animal models focused on the early, plaque-free stages of the disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the early behavioral, anatomical and molecular alterations in wild-type rats following intracerebroventricular injections of human Aβ oligomers (AβOs). Bioactive human AD and nondemented control brain tissue extracts were characterized using ELISA and proteomics approaches. Following a bilateral infusion, rats underwent behavioral testing, including the elevated plus maze, social recognition test, Morris water maze and Y-maze within 6 weeks postinjection. An analysis of brain structure was performed with manganese-enhanced MRI. Collected brain tissues were analyzed using stereology, immunohistochemistry, ELISA and qPCR. No sensorimotor deficits affecting motor performance on different maze tasks were observed, nor was spatial memory disturbed in AD rats. In contrast, a significant impairment of social memory became evident at 21 days postinjection. This deficit was associated with a significantly decreased volume of the lateral entorhinal cortex and a tendency toward a decrease in the total brain volume. Significant increase of cleaved caspase-3-positive cells, microglial activation and proinflammatory responses accompanied by altered expression of synaptic markers were observed in the hippocampus of AD rats with immunohistochemical and qPCR approaches at 6 weeks postinjection. Our data suggest that the social memory impairment observed in AβO-injected rats might be determined by neuroinflammatory responses and synaptopathy. An infusion of native oligomeric Aβ in the rat brain represents a feasible tool to model early plaque-free events associated with AD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35974377,NA,2022,10.1186/s40478-022-01417-5,,,,pubmed-35974377,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b;03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Laurel Renton;Ella Lambert,Excluded;Excluded,Excluded

N ",Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research,Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research,Objective: The objective of the study was to evaluate the protective effect of gallic acid on cisplatin-induced memory impairment (MI) in the rat model. Method(s): Five groups of Wistar albino rats (n=6) were employed and the duration of the study was 22 days excluding the pre-treatment period. Animals were pretreated with gallic acid for a period of 5 days and continued daily (200 mg/kg) for 22 days. The cisplatin (3 mg/kg) was given once in a week for 3 consecutive weeks to induce MI whereas donepezil was used as standard. The evaluation was done by a change in body weight memory activity by Morris water maze (MWM) locomotor activity by actophotometer antioxidant activity by thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) glutathione (GSH) and estimation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in brain homogenate. Result(s): Administration of cisplatin has induced MI by increasing in escape latency time decrease in time spent in the target quadrant in the MWM task and it was reversed by gallic acid treatment. Decreased locomotor activity by cisplatin was also increased by gallic acid when tested by actophotometer. Cisplatin administration has induced oxidative stress by increasing TBARS and decreasing GSH levels. Gallic acid due to its proven antioxidant activity reversed the effects of cisplatin. The AChE level was significantly increased in the control group whereas treatment groups have shown a decrease in AChE level. Conclusion(s): Gallic acid may serve as a primary agent to treat the cognitive impairment and oxidative stress associated memory dysfunctions. However more extensive studies are needed before utilization in the clinical trial.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.,https://innovareacademics.in/journals/index.php/ajpcr/article/view/36932https://www.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&AN=2005531020https://ed.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44UOE_INST/44UOE_INST:44UOE_VU2?sid=OVID:embase&id=pmid:&id=doi:10.22159%2Fajpcr.2020.v13i4.36932&issn=0974-2441&isbn=&volume=13&issue=4&spage=&pages=&date=2020&title=Asian+Journal+of+Pharmaceutical+and+Clinical+Research&atitle=Reversal+of+cisplatin-induced+memory+impairment+by+gallic+acid+in+experimental+rat+model&aulast=Patel,"(Patel Chandan Krishna Nandini Ghosh Bhooshitha) Department of Pharmacology JSS College of Pharmacy JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research Mysuru Karnataka IndiaK.L.

B.Deng J.Ujla D.Sait H. B. R.Neubert T. A.Kong X. P.Sigurdsson E. M ",EBioMedicine,EBioMedicine,BACKGROUND: Bringing antibodies from pre-clinical studies to human trials requires humanization but this process may alter properties that are crucial for efficacy. Since pathological tau protein is primarily intraneuronal in Alzheimer's disease the most efficacious antibodies should work both intra- and extracellularly. Thus changes which impact uptake or antibody binding will affect antibody efficacy. METHODS: Initially we examined four tau mouse monoclonal antibodies with naturally differing charges. We quantified their neuronal uptake and efficacy in preventing toxicity and pathological seeding induced by human-derived pathological tau. Later we generated a human chimeric 4E6 (h4E6) an antibody with well documented efficacy in multiple tauopathy models. We compared the uptake and efficacy of unmodified and chimeric antibodies in neuronal and differentiated neuroblastoma cultures. Further we analyzed tau binding using ELISA assays. FINDINGS: Neuronal uptake of tau antibodies and their efficacy strongly depends on antibody charge. Additionally their ability to prevent tau toxicity and seeding of tau pathology does not necessarily go together. Particularly chimerization of 4E6 increased its charge from 6.5 to 9.6 which blocked its uptake into human and mouse cells. Furthermore h4E6 had altered binding characteristics despite intact binding sites compared to the mouse antibody. Importantly these changes in uptake and binding substantially decreased its efficacy in preventing tau toxicity although under certain conditions it did prevent pathological seeding of tau. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that efficacy of chimeric/humanized tau antibodies should be thoroughly characterized prior to clinical trials which may require further engineering to maintain or improve their therapeutic potential.

F.Jung Y. J.Hsueh S. C.Hoffer B. J.Becker R. E.Pick C. G.Lupica C. R.Greig N. H ",Neurobiol Dis,Neurobiol Dis,Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). TBI-derived neuropathologies are promoted by inflammatory processes: chronic microgliosis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that further promote neuronal dysfunction and loss. Herein we evaluated the effect on pre-programmed cell death/neuroinflammation/synaptic integrity and function of (-)-Phenserine tartrate (Phen) an agent originally developed for AD. This was studied at two clinically translatable doses (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg BID) in a weight drop (concussive) mTBI model in wild type (WT) and AD APP/PSEN1 transgenic mice. Phen mitigated mTBI-induced cognitive impairment assessed by Novel Object Recognition and Y-maze behavioral paradigms in WT mice. Phen fully abated mTBI-induced neurodegeneration evaluated by counting Fluoro-Jade C-positive (FJC+) cells in hippocampus and cortex of WT mice. In APP/PSEN1 mice degenerating cell counts were consistently greater across all experimental groups vs. WT mice. mTBI elevated FJC+ cell counts vs. the APP/PSEN1 control (sham) group and Phen similarly mitigated this. Anti-inflammatory effects on microglial activation (IBA1-immunoreactivity (IR)) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α were evaluated. mTBI increased IBA1-IR and TNF-α/IBA1 colocalization vs. sham both in WT and APP/PSEN1 mice. Phen decreased IBA1-IR throughout hippocampi and cortices of WT mice and in cortices of AD mice. Phen likewise reduced levels of IBA1/TNF-α-IR colocalization volume across all areas in WT animals with a similar trend in APP/PSEN1 mice. Actions on astrocyte activation by mTBI were followed by evaluating GFAP and were similarly mitigated by Phen. Synaptic density was evaluated by quantifying PSD-95+ dendritic spines and Synaptophysin (Syn)-IR. Both were significantly reduced in mTBI vs. sham in both WT and APP/PSEN1 mice. Phen fully reversed the PSD-95+ spine loss in WT and Syn-IR decrease in both WT and APP/PSEN1 mice. To associate immunohistochemical changes in synaptic markers with function hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) was induced in WT mice. LTP was impaired by mTBI and this impairment was mitigated by Phen. In synopsis clinically translatable doses of Phen ameliorated mTBI-mediated pre-programmed cell death/neuroinflammation/synaptic dysfunction in WT mice consistent with fully mitigating mTBI-induced cognitive impairments. Phen additionally demonstrated positive actions in the more pathologic brain microenvironment of AD mice further supporting consideration of its repurposing as a treatment for mTBI.,NA,"Translational Gerontology Branch Intramural Research Program National Institute on Aging NIH Baltimore MD 21224 USA.Department of Anatomy and Anthropology Sackler School of Medicine Tel-Aviv University Tel Aviv 69978 Israel.Electrophysiology Research Section Cellular Neurobiology Research Branch Intramural Research Program National Institute on Drug Abuse NIH 21224 Baltimore MD USA.Department of Neurosurgery Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine Cleveland OH 44106 USA.Translational Gerontology Branch Intramural Research Program National Institute on Aging NIH Baltimore MD 21224 USA; Aristea Translational Medicine Corporation Park City UT 84098 USA.Department of Anatomy and Anthropology Sackler School of Medicine Tel-Aviv University Tel Aviv 69978 Israel; Sagol School of Neuroscience Tel-Aviv University Tel-Aviv 69978 Israel; Center for the Biology of Addictive Diseases Tel-Aviv University Tel-Aviv 69978 Israel.Translational Gerontology Branch Intramural Research Program National Institute on Aging NIH Baltimore MD 21224 USA.

Nevertheless, how this missense variant confers schizophrenia risk remains unknown. Here we constructed a knock-in mouse model (by introducing a threonine at the 393th amino acid of mouse SLC39A8 (SLC39A8-p.393T), which corresponds to rs13107325 (p.Ala391Thr) of human SLC39A8) to explore the potential roles and biological effects of this missense variant in schizophrenia pathogenesis. We assessed multiple phenotypes and traits (associated with rs13107325) of the knock-in mice, including body and brain weight, concentrations of metal ions (including cadmium, zinc, manganese, and iron) transported by SLC39A8, blood lipids, proliferation and migration of neural stem cells (NSCs), cortical development, behaviors and cognition, transcriptome, dendritic spine density, and synaptic transmission. Many of the tested phenotypes did not show differences in SLC39A8-p.393T knock-in and wild-type mice. However, we found that zinc concentration in brain and blood of SLC39A8-p.393T knock-in mice was dysregulated compared with wild-types, validating the functionality of rs13107325. Further analysis indicated that cortical dendritic spine density of the SLC39A8-p.393T knock-in mice was significantly decreased compared with wild-types, indicating the important role of SLC39A8-p.393T in dendritic spine morphogenesis. These results indicated that SLC39A8-p.393T knock-in resulted in decreased dendritic spine density, thus mimicking the dendritic spine pathology observed in schizophrenia.

The molecular and cellular mechanism(s) by which Aβ and/or its precursor protein, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) can affect synapses remains unclear. Interestingly, early hyperexcitability has been described in human AD and mouse models of AD, which precedes later hypoactivity. Here we show that neurons in culture with either elevated levels of Aβ or with human APP mutated to prevent Aβ generation can both induce hyperactivity as detected by elevated calcium transient frequency and amplitude. Since homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) mechanisms normally maintain a setpoint of activity, we examined whether HSP was altered in AD transgenic neurons. Using methods known to induce HSP, we demonstrate that APP protein levels are regulated by chronic modulation of activity and that AD transgenic neurons have an impaired adaptation of calcium transients to global changes in activity. Further, AD transgenic compared to WT neurons failed to adjust the length of their axon initial segments (AIS), an adaptation known to alter excitability. Thus, we show that both APP and Aβ influence neuronal activity and that mechanisms of HSP are disrupted in primary neuron models of AD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35928998,NA,2022,10.3389/fnagi.2022.946297,,,,pubmed-35928998,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b,Laurel Renton,Included,Included

It has been previously described that higher levels of brain expression of Ca(v)1 channels are involved in major neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Our results demonstrate that a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-mediated transgenic mouse model (BACHD mice) at the age of 3 and 12 months exhibits significantly increased Ca(v)1.2 protein levels in the cortex as compared with wild-type littermates. Importantly electrophysiological analyses confirm a significant increase in L-type Ca(2+) currents and total Ca(2+) current density in cortical neurons from BACHD mice. By using an in vitro assay to measure neuronal cell death we were able to observe neuronal protection against glutamate toxicity after treatment with Ca(v)1 blockers in wild-type and more importantly in BACHD neurons. According to our data Ca(v)1 blockers may offer an interesting strategy for the treatment of HD.

The neuroprotective effects of erythropoietin (EPO) have been reported in some models of neurodegenerative disease but because of its hematopoietic side effects its derivatives lacking hematopoietic bioactivity is recommended. In this study the neuroprotective effects of carbamylated erythropoietin-Fc (CEPO-Fc) against beta amyloid-induced memory deficit were evaluated. Adult male Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g were bilaterally cannulated into CA1. Aβ(25-35) was administered intrahippocampally for 4 consecutive days (5 μg/2.5 μL/each side/day). CEPO-Fc (500 or 5000 IU) was injected intraperitoneally during days 4-9. Learning and memory performance of rats was assessed on days 10-13 using Morris Water Maze then hippocampi were isolated and the amount of activated forms of hippocampal MAPKs' subfamily Akt/GSK-3β and MMP-2 were analyzed using Western blot. From the behavioral results it was revealed that CEPO-Fc treatment in both 500 and 5000 IU significantly reversed Aβ-induced learning and memory deterioration. From the molecular analysis an increment of MAPKs and MMP-2 activity and an imbalance in Akt/GSK-3β signaling after Aβ(25-35) administration was observed. CEPO-Fc treatment prevented the elevation of hippocampal of P38 ERK MMP-2 activity and also Akt/GSK-3β signaling impairment induced by Aβ(25-35) but it had no effect on JNK. It seems that CEPO-Fc prevents Aβ-induced learning and memory deterioration and also modulates hippocampal MAPKs Akt/GSK-3β and MMP-2 activity. This study suggests that CEPO-Fc can be considered as a potential therapeutic strategy for memory deficits like AD.,NA,"Neuroscience Research Center Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences Tehran Iran.Nanobiology and Nanomedicine Research Centre Shiraz University of Medical Sciences Shiraz Iran; Shiraz Neuroscience Research Center Shiraz University of Medical Sciences Shiraz Iran.Department of Biotechnology University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna Austria.Department of Biology Queens College and Graduate Center of the City University of New York Flushing NY USA.Neurophysiology Research Center and Physiology Department Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences Tehran Iran.R&D Unit Humer Novin Daroo Tolid Co.

The anti-seizure drug levetiracetam (LEV) is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for ability to reduce epileptiform activity and improve cognitive function in AD. The purpose of our studies was to establish a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship with LEV in an amyloidogenic mouse model of AD to enable predictive preclinical to clinical translation, using the rigorous preclinical testing pipeline of the Model Organism Development and Evaluation for Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Preclinical Testing Core. Methods A multi-tier approach was applied that included quality assurance and quality control of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, PK/PD modeling, positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI), functional outcomes, and transcriptomics. 5XFAD mice were treated chronically with LEV for 3 months at doses in line with those allometrically scaled to the clinical dose range. Results Pharmacokinetics of LEV demonstrated sex differences in Cmax, AUC(0-infinity), and CL/F, and a dose dependence in AUC(0-infinity). After chronic dosing at 10, 30, 56 mg/kg, PET/MRI tracer F-18-AV45, and F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) showed specific regional differences with treatment. LEV did not significantly improve cognitive outcomes. Transcriptomics performed by nanoString demonstrated drug- and dose-related changes in gene expression relevant to human brain regions and pathways congruent with changes in F-18-FDG uptake. Discussion This study represents the first report of PK/PD assessment of LEV in 5XFAD mice. Overall, these results highlighted non-linear kinetics based on dose and sex. Plasma concentrations of the 10 mg/kg dose in 5XFAD overlapped with human plasma concentrations used for studies of mild cognitive impairment, while the 30 and 56 mg/kg doses were reflective of doses used to treat seizure activity. Post-treatment gene expression analysis demonstrated LEV dose-related changes in immune function and neuronal-signaling pathways relevant to human AD, and aligned with regional F-18-FDG uptake. Overall, this study highlights the importance of PK/PD relationships in preclinical studies to inform clinical study design. Highlights Significant sex differences in pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were observed in 5XFAD mice. Plasma concentrations of 10 mg/kg levetiracetam dose in 5XFAD overlapped with human plasma concentration used in the clinic. Drug- and dose-related differences in gene expression relevant to human brain regions and pathways were also similar to brain region-specific changes in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake.",NA,Jackson Laboratory and Indiana University System and Indiana University Bloomington and Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE) and University of Pittsburgh,2022,10.1002/trc2.12329,,,,wos:000843195300001,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

The dynamic post-translational modification O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) has emerged as an attractive target for regulating aging-specific synaptic alterations as well as neurodegeneration. While speculation exists about the role of O-GlcNAc in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease its role in physiological brain aging remains largely unexplored. Here we report that countering age-related decreased O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) expression and O-GlcNAcylation ameliorates cognitive impairments in aged mice. Mimicking an aged condition in young adults by abrogating OGT using a temporally controlled neuron-specific conditional knockout mouse model recapitulated cellular and cognitive features of brain aging. Conversely overexpressing OGT in mature hippocampal neurons using a viral-mediated approach enhanced associative fear memory in young adult mice. Excitingly in aged mice overexpressing neuronal OGT in the aged hippocampus rescued in part age-related impairments in spatial learning and memory as well as associative fear memory.

J ",J Alzheimers Dis,J Alzheimers Dis,BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that aging is associated with an exaggerated response to surgical trauma together with cognitive impairments. This has significant implications for the development of clinical phenotype such as perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) which is a common complication following surgery especially for the elderly. However the mechanism by which aging brain is vulnerable to surgical trauma remains to be elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To test whether age-related alterations in hippocampal network activities contribute to increased risk of PND following surgery. METHODS: Thirty-two adult and seventy-two aged male C57BL/6 mice undergone sevoflurane anesthesia and exploratory laparotomy were used to mimic human abdominal surgery. For the interventional study mice were treated with minocycline. Behavioral tests were performed post-surgery with open field novel object recognition and fear conditioning tests respectively. The brain tissues were then harvested and subjected to biochemistry studies. Local field potential (LFP) recording was performed in another separate experiment. RESULTS: Aged mice displayed signs of neuroinflammation as reflected by significantly increased proinflammatory mediators in the hippocampus. Also aged mice displayed persistently decreased oscillation activities under different conditions both before and after surgery. Further correlation analysis suggested that theta power was positively associated with time with novel object while γ oscillation activity was positively associated with freezing time to context. Of note downregulation of neuroinflammation by microglia inhibitor minocycline reversed some of these abnormities. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights that age-related hippocampal oscillation dysregulation increases the risk of PND incidence which might provide diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for PND and possible other neurodegenerative diseases.,NA,"Department of Anesthesiology the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University Nanjing China.Department of Anesthesiology Jinling Hospital School of Medicine Nanjing University Nanjing China.Department of Anesthesiology Pain and Perioperative Medicine The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University Zhengzhou China.",2021,10.3233/jad-201590,,,,pubmed-33967044,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

After extensive validation, experiments in a relevant animal model clarified the optimal timing of the treatment window. PEP3 administration was effective for the rescue of cognitive defects in APP/PS1 mice only if administered at an early disease stage. Increased ADAM10 activity promoted synaptic plasticity, as revealed by changes in the molecular compositions of synapses and the spine morphology. Even though further studies are required to evaluate efficacy and safety issues of long-term administration of PEP3, these results provide preclinical evidence to support the therapeutic potential of PEP3 in AD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35390543,NA,2022,10.1016/j.ymthe.2022.03.024,,,,pubmed-35390543,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

J.Fukunaga K ",Int J Mol Sci,Int J Mol Sci,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by neuropathological hallmarks consisting of accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Recently we have identified a new AD therapeutic candidate ethyl-8'-methyl-2'4-dioxo-2-(piperidin-1-yl)-2'H-spiro[cyclopentane-13'-imidazo [12-a] pyridin]-2-ene-3-carboxylate (SAK3) which ameliorates the AD-like pathology in AppNL-F/NL-F knock-in mice. However the detailed mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of SAK3 remains unclear. In this study we found that SAK3 administration improved the reduced proteasome activity through the activation of CaMKII/Rpt6 signaling in AppNL-F/NL-F knock-in (NL-G-F) mice. Moreover spine abnormalities observed in NL-G-F mice were significantly reversed by SAK3 administration. Along with this cognitive impairments found in NL-G-F mice were markedly ameliorated by SAK3. In summary our data suggest that SAK3 administration increases the activity of the proteasome via activation of the CaMKII/Rpt6 signaling pathway contributing to improvements in spine abnormalities and cognitive deficits in NL-G-F mice. Overall our findings suggest that SAK3 might be a new attractive drug candidate representing a new mechanism for the treatment of AD pathology.,NA,"Department of Pharmacology Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences Tohoku University Sendai 980-8578 Japan.Department of Psychology University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Milwaukee WI 53201 USA.",2020,10.3390/ijms21113833,,,,pubmed-32481611,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

A.Alipour F.Hosseini Ravandi H.Karimzadeh F ",J Cell Physiol,J Cell Physiol,The critical role of Notch signaling has been shown in the pathogenesis of some neurological disorders including schizophrenia epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. This study was aimed to evaluate the role of Notch 1 receptor in epileptogenesis as well as seizure characteristics. The animals were divided into three groups of sham early stage and end stage. In sham group: Normal saline was injected intraperitoneally (ip) in the same as protocol of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) injection. PTZ was injected (ip) every 48 hr over a period of 1 week in the group of early stage and over a period of 4 weeks in the end stage. The gene expression as well as distribution of Notch 1 receptor was assessed in the parietal cortex and hippocampus. In addition the effect of agonist or antagonist of Notch 1 receptor was assessed on the epileptic discharges induced by PTZ injection. The gene expression of Notch 1 decreased in the hippocampus significantly in the end-stage group compared with sham and early groups. Furthermore distribution of Notch 1 receptor increased in the somatosensory cortex and decreased in the CA1 hippocampal area in the end-stage group. Intraventricular microinjection of Notch 1 agonist significantly increased the amplitude as well as frequency of spikes and decreased the latency of first epileptic discharges.

M.Ardiles Á O ",Front Cell Neurosci,Front Cell Neurosci,Synaptic loss induced by soluble oligomeric forms of the amyloid β peptide (sAβos) is one of the earliest events in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is thought to be the major cause of the cognitive deficits. These abnormalities rely on defects in synaptic plasticity a series of events manifested as activity-dependent modifications in synaptic structure and function. It has been reported that pannexin 1 (Panx1) a nonselective channel implicated in cell communication and intracellular signaling modulates the induction of excitatory synaptic plasticity under physiological contexts and contributes to neuronal death under inflammatory conditions. Here we decided to study the involvement of Panx1 in functional and structural defects observed in excitatory synapses of the amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic (Tg) mice an animal model of AD. We found an age-dependent increase in the Panx1 expression that correlates with increased Aβ levels in hippocampal tissue from Tg mice. Congruently we also observed an exacerbated Panx1 activity upon basal conditions and in response to glutamate receptor activation. The acute inhibition of Panx1 activity with the drug probenecid (PBN) did not change neurodegenerative parameters such as amyloid deposition or astrogliosis but it significantly reduced excitatory synaptic defects in the AD model by normalizing long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression and improving dendritic arborization and spine density in hippocampal neurons of the Tg mice. These results suggest a major contribution of Panx1 in the early mechanisms leading to the synaptopathy in AD. Indeed PBN induced a reduction in the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) a kinase widely implicated in the early neurotoxic signaling in AD. Our data strongly suggest that an enhanced expression and activation of Panx1 channels contribute to the Aβ-induced cascades leading to synaptic dysfunction in AD.,NA,"Centro de Neurología Traslacional Facultad de Medicina Universidad de Valparaíso Valparaíso Chile.Centro Interdisciplinario de Neurociencia de Valparaíso Universidad de Valparaíso Valparaíso Chile.Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Mención Neurociencia Universidad de Valparaíso Valparaíso Chile.Escuela de Tecnología Médica Facultad de Medicina Universidad de Valparaíso Valparaíso Chile.Laboratorio de Estructura y Función Celular Facultad de Medicina Universidad de Valparaíso Valparaíso Chile.Centro de Investigaciones Biomédicas Escuela de Medicina Universidad de Valparaíso Valparaíso Chile.Center for Social and Cognitive Neuroscience (CSCN) School of Psychology Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez Santiago de Chile Chile.Biomedical Neuroscience Institute Faculty of Medicine University of Chile Santiago Chile.Center for Geroscience Brain Health and Metabolism Santiago Chile.Program of Cellular and Molecular Biology Institute of Biomedical Sciences University of Chile Santiago Chile.Centro Interdisciplinario de Estudios en Salud Facultad de Medicina Universidad de Valparaíso Viña del Mar Chile.",2020,10.3389/fncel.2020.00046,,,,pubmed-32265655,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b,Laurel Renton,Included,Included

J ",Neurobiol Dis,Neurobiol Dis,Pro-inflammatory mechanisms have recently emerged as an important component of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. A particularly attractive therapeutic strategy is to selectively prevent the disruptive effects of activation of the innate immune system in the brain at an early transitional stage by reducing the production or directly neutralizing pro-inflammatory cytokines in particular IL-1β and TNF-α. Here we tested their in vivo effects on synaptic plasticity deficits which provide sensitive and robust measures of synaptic failure in a rat model of AD amyloidosis. Using electrophysiological techniques we longitudinally studied the effects of the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor Mcc950 the IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) and an anti-TNF-α agent (etanercept) in awake freely moving transgenic rats overexpressing AD associated β-amyloid precursor protein at a pre-plaque stage of amyloidosis. Repeated treatment with Mcc950 reversibly abrogated the inhibition of long-term potentiation. The IL-1 receptor antagonist and etanercept also had a similar beneficial effect on the deficit in synaptic plasticity.

D.Podda M. V.Grassi C ",Front Cell Dev Biol,Front Cell Dev Biol,Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) supposedly increases the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. However presently available diagnostic procedures are either invasive or require complex and expensive technologies which cannot be applied at a larger scale to screen populations at risk of AD. We were looking for a biomarker allowing to unveil a dysfunction of molecular mechanisms which underly synaptic plasticity and memory before the AD phenotype is manifested and investigated the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in 3×Tg-AD mice an experimental model of AD which does not exhibit any long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory deficits at the age of 3 months (3×Tg-AD-3M). Our results demonstrated that tDCS differentially affected 3×Tg-AD-3M and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. While tDCS increased LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses and memory in WT mice it failed to elicit these effects in 3×Tg-AD-3M mice. Remarkably 3×Tg-AD-3M mice did not show the tDCS-dependent increases in pCREB (Ser133) and pCaMKII (Thr286)  which were found in WT mice. Of relevance tDCS induced a significant increase of plasma BDNF levels in WT mice which was not found in 3×Tg-AD-3M mice. Collectively our results showed that plasticity mechanisms are resistant to tDCS effects in the pre-AD stage. In particular the lack of BDNF responsiveness to tDCS in 3×Tg-AD-3M mice suggests that combining tDCS with dosages of plasma BDNF levels may provide an easy-to-detect and low-cost biomarker of covert impairment of synaptic plasticity mechanisms underlying memory which could be clinically applicable.

Neural oscillations and their interactions support brain communication and involve in cognitive function. Although arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been linked to spatial learning and memory the effects of AVP on CCH in terms of the hippocampal neural network is unknown. Here we investigated the dynamics of neural oscillations in the hippocampus in a rat model of permanent bilateral carotid arteries occlusion (two-vessel occlusion 2VO) under urethane-anesthesia. Hypertonic saline (5.3%) was injected intraperitoneally to induce the endogenous AVP and SR49059 was used as V1a receptor (an AVP receptor) antagonist. The results showed that AVP partly changed CA3 Schaffer collateral (CA3-SC) power distribution in the rat model of 2VO via V1a receptor increased theta synchrony between CA3-SC and CA1 areas enhanced CA3-SC theta-middle gamma phase-phase coupling and improved spatial learning and memory performance. Biochemical fractionation further confirmed the recovery effect on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) surface expressions after hypertonic saline injection suggesting a possible molecular mechanism in the hippocampus. The findings shed light on a functional role of endogenous AVP from a neural network perspective that AVP improves theta synchronization and accurate coordination of theta-gamma coupling probably through upregulating NR2B and PSD-95 expressions and further promotes neural communication in the hippocampus to some extent.

L ",Biology of the Cell,Biology of the Cell,Neural stem cell (NSC) activity and adult neurogenesis are physiologically relevant regulators of adult brain structure function and repair. Given these roles the NSC impairments observed in a wide range of neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions likely factor into the overall cognitive dysfunction in these conditions. We investigated NSC regulation in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using the well-characterised triple transgenic (3xTg) model of AD. In this review we describe our recent findings that link 3xTg-AD neurogenesis impairments to AD-associated abnormalities in brain fatty acid metabolism. Notably we identified an accumulation of triglycerides rich in oleic acid a mono-unsaturated fatty acid within the forebrain NSC niche in AD. Inhibiting the local conversion of saturated to mono-unsaturated fatty acids within the brain was sufficient to counteract the loss of NSC activity in 3xTg-AD mice (Hamilton et al. 2015). We place these findings within the context of recent evidence that dynamic changes in lipid metabolism occur during the transition from NSC quiescence to activation. The picture that emerges is that the critical NSC quiescence-to-activation decision is sensitive to the local levels of specific fatty acids and can be impaired by a disease-associated shift in brain fatty acid balance.

D.Tolwinski N.Gruber J ",Translational Medicine of Aging,Translational Medicine of Aging,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline is one of the diseases with the highest attrition rate in drug development. As with other neurodegenerative diseases AD manifests on several scales (molecular cellular and organismal) resulting in an organismal phenotype that is difficult to replicate and exploit for screening in vitro. Development of high-throughput drug screening platforms using invertebrate organisms may therefore facilitate drug discovery in AD at least for compounds that target mechanisms that can be modelled in invertebrates such as metabolic defects and mitochondrial toxicity. Here we present a potentially high-throughput screening platform against AD in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). The system is based on our transgenic AD model strain (GRU102) that expresses a pathogenic human amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta1-42) specifically in neurons and we use this approach to identify Metformin Lithium and Curcumin as potential ""hits"". We find that the ability to rescue the swim-exhaustion phenotype correlates well with lifespan and healthspan improvements in GRU102. Importantly several other drugs such as Thioflavin T that have been reported previously to extend lifespan modify aspects of ageing or for which protective effects in AD model might be suspected did not rescue the swim performance nor lifespan of GRU102. This illustrates the predictive value of the screening assay and confirms that not all compounds targeting ageing are capable of compensating for the toxic effects of Abeta1-42 in GRU102. Together these findings demonstrate the utility of our screen towards the Abeta-induced defects in GRU102.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",http://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/translational-medicine-of-aging/https://www.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&AN=2004561967https://ed.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44UOE_INST/44UOE_INST:44UOE_VU2?sid=OVID:embase&id=pmid:&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.tma.2019.12.002&issn=2468-5011&isbn=&volume=4&issue=&spage=11&pages=11-21&date=2020&title=Translational+Medicine+of+Aging&atitle=A+high+throughput+drug+screening+paradigm+using+transgenic+Caenorhabditis+elegans+model+of+Alzheimer%27s+disease&aulast=Teo,"(Teo) NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering National University of Singapore Singapore (Teo Tolwinski Gruber) Science Division Yale-NUS College Singapore (Lim Wright) A*STAR Microscopy Platform Skin Research Institute of Singapore Agency for Science Technology and Research Singapore (Fong) Geriatric Medicine Senior Residency Programme SingHealth Duke-NUS Academic Medical Centre Singapore (Larbi) Singapore Immunology Network Agency for Science Technology and Research SingaporeJ.

M ",Psychopharmacology (Berl),Psychopharmacology (Berl),RATIONALE: Associated with frank neuropathology patients with Alzheimer's disease suffer from a host of neuropsychiatric symptoms that include depression apathy agitation and aggression. Negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of α5-containing GABA(A) receptors have been suggested to be a novel target for antidepressant action. We hypothesized that pharmacological modulation of this target would engender increased motivation in stressful environments. METHODS: We utilized electrophysiological recordings from Xenopus oocytes and behavioral measures in mice to address this hypothesis. RESULTS: In the forced-swim assay in mice that detects antidepressant drugs the α5β3γ2 GABA(Α) receptor NAM RY-080 produced a marked antidepressant phenotype. Another compound PWZ-029 was characterized as an α5β3γ2 receptor NAM of lower intrinsic efficacy in electrophysiological studies in Xenopus oocytes. In contrast to RY-080 PWZ-029 was only moderately active in the forced-swim assay and the α5β3γ2 receptor antagonist Xli-093 was not active at all. The effects of RY-080 were prevented by the non-selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil as well as by the selective ligands PWZ-029 and Xli-093. These findings demonstrate that this effect of RY-080 is driven by negative allosteric modulation of α5βγ2 GABA(A) receptors. RY-080 was not active in the tail-suspension test. We also demonstrated a reduction in the age-dependent hyperactivity exhibited by transgenic mice that accumulate pathological tau (rTg4510 mice) by RY-080. The decrease in hyperactivity by RY-080 was selective for the hyperactivity of the rTg4510 mice since the locomotion of control strains of mice were not significantly affected by RY-080.

Jr.Romano A.Stecca C.Passarella S.Steardo L.Cassano T.Scuderi C ",Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder responsible for the majority of dementia cases in elderly people. It is widely accepted that the main hallmarks of AD are not only senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles but also reactive astrogliosis which often precedes detrimental deposits and neuronal atrophy. Such phenomenon facilitates the regeneration of neural networks; however under some circumstances like in AD reactive astrogliosis is detrimental depriving neurons of the homeostatic support thus contributing to neuronal loss. We investigated the presence of reactive astrogliosis in 3×Tg-AD mice and the effects of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) a well-documented anti-inflammatory molecule by in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro results revealed a basal reactive state in primary cortical 3×Tg-AD-derived astrocytes and the ability of PEA to counteract such phenomenon and improve viability of 3×Tg-AD-derived neurons. In vivo observations performed using ultramicronized- (um-) PEA a formulation endowed with best bioavailability confirmed the efficacy of this compound. Moreover the schedule of treatment mimicking the clinic use (chronic daily administration) revealed its beneficial pharmacological properties in dampening reactive astrogliosis and promoting the glial neurosupportive function.

Avenanthramide-C (Avn-C) a polyphenol compound found predominantly in oats has a range of biological properties. Herein we performed methanolic extraction of the Avns-rich fraction (Fr. 2) from germinated oats using column chromatography and examined the effects of Avn-C on synaptic correlates of memory in a mouse model of AD. Avn-C was identified in Fr. 2 based on (1)H-NMR analysis. Electrophysiological recordings were performed to examine the effects of Avn-C on the hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in a Tg2576 mouse model of AD. Avn-C from germinated oats restored impaired LTP in Tg2576 mouse hippocampal slices. Furthermore Avn-C-facilitated LTP was associated with changes in the protein levels of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK3β-S9) and cleaved caspase 3 which are involved in Aβ-induced synaptic impairment.

Brain cholinergic signaling through basal forebrain projections to the hippocampus is an established pathway mediating fear response and cognitive flexibility. Here we employed a genetic strategy to enhance cholinergic activity through increased signaling of the NGF receptor TrkA. This strategy leads to increased levels of the marker of cholinergic activation, acetylcholine synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase, in forebrain cholinergic regions and their projection areas such as the hippocampus. Mice with increased cholinergic activity do not display any neurobehavioral abnormalities except a selective attenuation of fear response and lower fear expression in extinction trials. Reduction in fear response is rescued by the GABA antagonist picrotoxin in mutant mice, and, in wild-type mice, is mimicked by the GABA agonist midazolam suggesting that GABA can modulate cholinergic functions on fear circuitries. Importantly, mutant mice also show a reduction in fear processing under stress conditions in a single prolonged stress (SPS) model of PTSD-like behavior, and augmentation of cholinergic signaling by the drug donepezil in wild-type mice promotes extinction learning in a similar SPS model of PTSD-like behavior.

Y ",Eur J Med Chem,Eur J Med Chem,Cholinergic neurons are ubiquitous and involved in various higher brain functions including learning and memory. Patients with Alzheimer's disease exhibit significant dysfunction and loss of cholinergic neurons. Meanwhile such cholinergic deficits can be potentially relieved pharmacologically by increasing acetylcholine. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors have been used to improve cholinergic transmission in the brain for two decades and have proven effective for alleviating symptoms in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore the search for AChE inhibitors for drug development is ongoing. The enzymatic pocket of AChE has long been the target of several drug designs over the last two decades. The peripheral and catalytic sites of AChE are simultaneously bound by several dimeric molecules enabling more-efficient inhibition. Here we used 6-chlorotacrine and the tetrahydroquinolone moiety of huperzine A to design and synthesize a series of heterodimers that inhibit AChE at nanomolar potency. Specifically compound 7b inhibits AChE with an IC(50) < 1 nM and spares butyrylcholinesterase. Administration of 7b to mouse brain slices restores synaptic activity impaired by pirenzepine a muscarinic M1-selective antagonist. Moreover oral administration of 7b to C57BL/6 mice enhances hippocampal long-term potentiation in a dose-dependent manner and is detectable in the brain tissue. All these data supported that 7b is a potential cognitive enhancer and is worth for further exploration.,NA,"Division of Life Science State Key Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience and Molecular Neuroscience Center The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Clear Water Bay Kowloon Hong Kong China; Hong Kong Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases Hong Kong Science Park Hong Kong China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Brain Science Disease and Drug Development Shenzhen-Hong Kong Institute of Brain Science HKUST Shenzhen Research Institute Shenzhen Guangdong 518057 China.Division of Life Science State Key Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience and Molecular Neuroscience Center The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Clear Water Bay Kowloon Hong Kong China.School of Pharmacy Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shanghai China.School of Pharmacy Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shanghai China.

Y ",Neural Regen Res,Neural Regen Res,Optogenetics is a combination of optics and genetics technology that can be used to activate or inhibit specific cells in tissues. It has been used to treat Parkinson's disease epilepsy and neurological diseases but rarely Alzheimer's disease. Adeno-associated virus carrying the CaMK promoter driving the optogenetic channelrhodopsin-2 (CHR2) gene (or without the CHR2 gene as control) was injected into the bilateral dentate gyri followed by repeated intrahippocampal injections of soluble low-molecular-weight amyloid-β1-42 peptide (Aβ(1-42)). Subsequently the region was stimulated with a 473 nm laser (1-3 ms 10 Hz 5 minutes). The novel object recognition test was conducted to test memory function in mice. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to analyze the numbers of NeuN and synapsin Ia/b-positive cells in the hippocampus. Western blot assay was carried out to analyze the expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein NeuN synapsin Ia/b metabotropic glutamate receptor-1a (mGluR-1a) mGluR-5 N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit NR1 glutamate receptor 2 interleukin-1β interleukin-6 and interleukin-10. Optogenetic stimulation improved working and short-term memory in mice with Alzheimer's disease. This neuroprotective effect was associated with increased expression of NR1 glutamate receptor 2 and mGluR-5 in the hippocampus and decreased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and interleukin-6.

Here, we demonstrated disrupted cerebellar circuitry and poor motor recovery in ataxia mice after PNI. This effect was mimicked by deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) lesion, but not by damaging non-motor area hippocampus. By restoring cerebellar circuitry through DCN stimulation, and reversal of neurotransmitter imbalance using baclofen, ataxia mice achieve full motor recovery after PNI. Mechanistically, elevated glutamate-glutamine level was detected in DCN of ataxia mice by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Transcriptomic study revealed that Gria1, an ionotropic glutamate receptor, was upregulated in DCN of control mice but failed to be upregulated in ataxia mice after sciatic nerve crush. AAV-mediated overexpression of Gria1 in DCN rescued motor deficits of ataxia mice after PNI.

Z ",Theranostics,Theranostics,Intracellular accumulation of tau is a hallmark pathology in Alzheimer disease (AD) and the related tauopathies thus targeting tau could be promising for drug development. Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) is a novel drug discovery strategy for selective protein degradation from within cells. Methods: A novel small-molecule PROTAC named as C004019 with a molecular mass of 1035.29 dalton was designed to simultaneously recruite tau and E3-ligase (Vhl) and thus to selectively enhance ubiquitination and proteolysis of tau proteins. Western blotting immunofluoresence and immunohistochemical staining were employed to verify the effects of C004019 in cell models (HEK293 and SH-SY5Y) and mouse models (hTau-transgenic and 3xTg-AD) respectively. The cognitive capacity of the mice was assessed by a suite of behavior experiments. Electrophysiology and Golgi staining were used to evaluate the synaptic plasticity. Results: C004019 induced a robust tau clearance via promoting its ubiquitination-proteasome-dependent proteolysis in HEK293 cells with stable or transient overexpression of human tau (hTau) and in SH-SY5Y that constitutively overexpress hTau. Furthermore intracerebral ventricular infusion of C004019 induced a robust tau clearance in vivo. Most importantly both single-dose and multiple-doses (once per 6 days for a total 5 times) subcutaneous administration of C004019 remarkably decreased tau levels in the brains of wild-type hTau-transgenic and 3xTg-AD mice with improvement of synaptic and cognitive functions.

C ",Acta Neuropathol Commun,Acta Neuropathol Commun,The adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein APMAP is expressed in the brain where it associates with γ-secretase a protease responsible for the generation of the amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study behavioral investigations revealed spatial learning and memory deficiencies in our newly generated mouse line lacking the protein APMAP. In a mouse model of AD the constitutive deletion of APMAP worsened the spatial memory phenotype and led to increased Aβ production and deposition into senile plaques. To investigate at the molecular level the neurobiological functions of APMAP (memory and Aβ formation) and a possible link with the pathological hallmarks of AD (memory impairment and Aβ pathology) we next developed a procedure for the high-grade purification of cellular APMAP protein complexes. The biochemical characterization of these complexes revealed a series of new APMAP interactomers. Among these the heat shock protein HSPA1A and the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CD-M6PR) negatively regulated APP processing and Aβ production while clusterin calnexin arginase-1 PTGFRN and the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR/IGF2R) positively regulated APP and Aβ production.

An intricate balance between neurons astrocytes microglia oligodendrocytes and vascular cells sustains the normal neuronal circuits. Conversely cerebrovascular diseases overlap neuropathologically with AD and glial dyshomeostasis promotes AD-associated neurodegenerative cascade. While pathological hallmarks of AD primarily include amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles microvascular disorders altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability induce neuronal loss and synaptic atrophy. Accordingly microglia-mediated inflammation and astrogliosis disrupt the homeostasis of the neuro-vascular unit and stimulate infiltration of circulating leukocytes into the brain. Large-scale genetic and epidemiological studies demonstrate a critical role of cellular crosstalk for altered immune response metabolism and vasculature in AD. The glia associated genetic risk factors include APOE TREM2 CD33 PGRN CR1 and NLRP3 which correlate with the deposition and altered phagocytosis of Aβ. Moreover aging-dependent downregulation of astrocyte and microglial Aβ-degrading enzymes limits the neurotrophic and neurogenic role of glial cells and inhibits lysosomal degradation and clearance of Aβ. Microglial cells secrete IGF-1 and neurons show a reduced responsiveness to the neurotrophic IGF-1R/IRS-2/PI3K signaling pathway generating amyloidogenic and vascular dyshomeostasis in AD. Glial signals connect to neural stem cells and a shift in glial phenotype over the AD trajectory even affects adult neurogenesis and the neurovascular niche.

H ",Exp Neurol,Exp Neurol,Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is widely known for its multiple systems damage especially neurocognitive deficits in children. Since their discovery adenosine A(2A) receptors (A(2A)Rs) have been considered as key elements in signaling pathways mediating neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's and Alzheimer's as well as cognitive function regulation. Herein we investigated A(2A)R role in cognitive impairment induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Mice were exposed to CIH 7 h every day for 4 weeks and intraperitoneally injected with A(2A)R agonist CGS21680 or A(2A)R antagonist SCH58261 half an hour before IH exposure daily. The 8-arm radial arm maze was utilized to assess spatial memory after CIH exposures.To validate findings using pharmacology the impact of intermittent hypoxia was investigated in A(2A)R knockout mice. CIH-induced memory dysfunction was manifested by increased error rates in the radial arm maze test. The behavioral changes were associated with hippocampal pathology neuronal apoptosis and synaptic plasticity impairment. The stimulation of adenosine A(2A)R exacerbated memory impairment with more serious neuropathological damage attenuated long-term potentiation (LTP) syntaxin down-regulation and increased BDNF protein. Moreover apoptosis-promoting protein cleaved caspase-3 was upregulated while anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was downregulated. Consistent with these findings A(2A)R inhibition with SCH58261 and A(2A)R deletion exhibited the opposite result. Overall these findings suggest that A(2A)R plays a critical role in CIH-induced impairment of learning and memory by accelerating hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and reducing synaptic plasticity.

K.Hosseini Kahnouei M.Vallerand D.Hamel E.Girouard H ",Front Physiol,Front Physiol,Alzheimer's disease (AD) the most common form of dementia is characterized by neuronal degeneration and cerebrovascular dysfunction. Increasing evidence indicates that cerebrovascular dysfunction may be a key or an aggravating pathogenic factor in AD. This emphasizes the importance to investigate the tight coupling between neuronal activity and cerebral blood flow (CBF) termed neurovascular coupling (NVC). NVC depends on all cell types of the neurovascular unit within which astrocytes are important players in the progression of AD. Hence the objective of this study was to characterize the hippocampal NVC in a mouse model of AD. Hippocampal NVC was studied in 6-month-old amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice and their corresponding wild-type littermates using in vivo laser Doppler flowmetry to measure CBF in area CA1 of the hippocampus in response to Schaffer collaterals stimulation. Ex vivo two-photon microscopy experiments were performed to determine astrocytic Ca(2+) and vascular responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS) or caged Ca(2+) photolysis in hippocampal slices. Neuronal synaptic transmission astrocytic endfeet Ca(2+) in correlation with reactive oxygen species (ROS) and vascular reactivity in the presence or absence of Tempol a mimetic of superoxide dismutase were further investigated using electrophysiological caged Ca(2+) photolysis or pharmacological approaches. Whisker stimulation evoked-CBF increases and ex vivo vascular responses to EFS were impaired in APP mice compared with their age-matched controls. APP mice were also characterized by decreased basal synaptic transmission a shorter astrocytic Ca(2+) increase and altered vascular response to elevated perivascular K(+). However long-term potentiation astrocytic Ca(2+) amplitude in response to EFS together with vascular responses to nitric oxide remained unchanged. Importantly we found a significantly increased Ca(2+) uncaging-induced ROS production in APP mice. Tempol prevented the vascular response impairment while normalizing astrocytic Ca(2+) in APP mice. These findings suggest that NVC is altered at many levels in APP mice at least in part through oxidative stress.

H.Li M ",Neurochem Res,Neurochem Res,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases and no effective therapies have been found to prevent or cure AD to date. Berberine and curcumin are extracts from traditional Chinese herbs that have a long history of clinical benefits for AD. Here using a transgenic AD mouse model we found that the combined berberine and curcumin treatment had a much better effect on improving the cognitive function of mice than the single-drug treatment suggesting synergic effects of the combined berberine and curcumin treatment. In addition we found that the combined berberine and curcumin treatment had significant synergic effects on reducing soluble amyloid-β-peptide((1-42)) production. Furthermore the combination treatment also had remarkable synergic effects on decreasing inflammatory responses and oxidative stress in both the cortex and hippocampus of AD mice. We also found that the combination treatment performed much better than the single drugs in reducing the APP and BACE1 levels and increasing AMPKα phosphorylation and cell autophagy which might be the underlying mechanism of the synergic effects. Taken together the result of this study reveal the synergic effects and potential underlying mechanisms of the combined berberine and curcumin treatment in improving the symptoms of AD in mice.

L.Forcelli P. A.Pak D. T. S.Wu J. Y.Conant K.Vicini S ",J Neurosci,J Neurosci,Memory disruption in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is poorly understood particularly at early stages preceding neurodegeneration. In mouse models of AD there are disruptions to sharp wave ripples (SWRs) hippocampal population events with a critical role in memory consolidation. However the microcircuitry underlying these disruptions is under-explored. We tested whether a selective reduction in parvalbumin-expressing (PV) inhibitory interneuron activity underlies hyperactivity and SWR disruption. We employed the 5xFAD model of familial AD crossed with mouse lines labeling excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and inhibitory PV cells. We observed a 33% increase in frequency 58% increase in amplitude and 8% decrease in duration of SWRs in ex vivo slices from male and female three-month 5xFAD mice versus littermate controls. 5xFAD mice of the same age were impaired in a hippocampal-dependent memory task. Concurrent with SWR recordings we performed calcium imaging cell-attached and whole-cell recordings of PC and PV cells within the CA1 region. PCs in 5xFAD mice participated in enlarged ensembles with superficial PCs (sPCs) having a higher probability of spiking during SWRs. Both deep PCs (dPCs) and sPCs displayed an increased synaptic E/I ratio suggesting a disinhibitory mechanism. In contrast we observed a 46% spike rate reduction during SWRs in PV basket cells (PVBCs) while PV bistratified and axo-axonic cells were unimpaired. Excitatory synaptic drive to PVBCs was selectively reduced by 50% resulting in decreased E/I ratio. Considering prior studies of intrinsic PV cell dysfunction in AD these findings suggest alterations to the PC-PVBC microcircuit also contribute to impairment.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We demonstrate that a specific subtype of inhibitory neuron parvalbumin-expressing (PV) basket cells have selectively reduced activity in a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) during activity critical for the consolidation of memory. These results identify a potential cellular target for therapeutic intervention to restore aberrant network activity in early amyloid pathology. While PV cells have previously been identified as a potential therapeutic target this study for the first time recognizes that other PV neuronal subtypes including bistratified and axo-axonic cells are spared. These experiments are the first to record synaptic and spiking activity during sharp wave ripple (SWR) events in early amyloid pathology and reveal that a selective decrease in excitatory synaptic drive to PV basket cells (PVBCs) likely underlies reduced function.,NA,"Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience Georgetown University Medical Center Washington DC 20057 ac1625@georgetown.edu.Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience Georgetown University Medical Center Washington DC 20057.Department of Pharmacology and Physiology Georgetown University Medical Center Washington DC 20057.Department of Neuroscience Georgetown University Medical Center Washington DC 20057.",2020,10.1523/jneurosci.0425-20.2020,,,,pubmed-32439703,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Included,Included

As recent studies have associated changes in adipokines and other metabolites in the central nervous system with a risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) we investigated the effects of adiponectin treatment on hippocampal cells in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD and neuronal SH-SY5Y cells under amyloid beta toxicity. Adiponectin treatment reduced levels of cleaved caspase 3 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) apoptosis signalling and decreased glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) activation. Moreover adiponectin treatment triggered long-term potentiation in the hippocampi of 5XFAD mice which was associated with reduced expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate and its receptor as well as surface expression of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor.

The TgF344-AD rat model has been well characterized and shows molecular behavioral and brain connectivity alterations that resemble the silent period of the pathology. Our aim was to longitudinally investigate functional brain connectivity in established resting-state networks (RSNs) obtained by independent component analysis (ICA) in a cohort of TgF344-AD and control rats every 3 months from 5 to 18 months of age to cover different stages of the disease. Before each acquisition working memory performance was evaluated by the delayed non match-to-sample (DNMS) task. Differences in the temporal evolution were observed between groups in the amplitude and shape of the somatosensorial and sensorimotor networks but not in the whole default mode network (DMN). Subsequent high dimensional ICA analysis showed early alterations in the anterior DMN subnetwork activity of TgF344-AD rats compared to controls. Performance of DNMS task was positively correlated with somatosensorial network at 5 months of age in the wild-type (WT) animals but not in the Tg-F344 rats. At different time points DMN showed negative correlation with cognitive performance in the control group while in the transgenic group the correlation was positive. In addition behavioral differences observed at 5 months of age correlated with alterations in the posterior DMN subnetwork. We have demonstrated that functional connectivity using ICA represents a useful biomarker also in animal models of AD such as the TgF344AD rats as it allows the identification of alterations associated with the progression of the disease detecting differences in specific networks even at very early stages.,NA,"Consorcio Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red (CIBER) de Bioingeniería Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN) Group of Biomedical Imaging University of Barcelona Barcelona Spain.Experimental 7T MRI Unit Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi I Sunyer (IDIBAPS) Barcelona Spain.Department of Biomedicine Faculty of Medicine University of Barcelona Barcelona Spain.",2019,10.3389/fnagi.2019.00213,,,,pubmed-31440158,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

U.Khan A.Badshah H.Abid N. B.Kim M. W.Jo M. H.Chung S. S.Lee H. G.Rutten B. P. F.Kim M. O ",Mol Neurodegener,Mol Neurodegener,BACKGROUND: Recently we and other researchers reported that brain metabolic disorders are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) a progressive devastating and incurable neurodegenerative disease. Hence novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to explore potential and novel therapeutic targets/agents for the treatment of AD. The neuronal adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) is an emerging potential target for intervention in metabolic-associated AD. We aimed to validate this hypothesis and explore in-depth the therapeutic effects of an osmotin-derived adiponectin-mimetic novel nonapeptide (Os-pep) on metabolic-associated AD. METHODS: We used an Os-pep dosage regimen (5 μg/g i.p. on alternating days for 45 days) for APP/PS1 in amyloid β oligomer-injected transgenic adiponectin knockout (Adipo-/-) and AdipoR1 knockdown mice. After behavioral studies brain tissues were subjected to biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. In separate cohorts of mice electrophysiolocal and Golgi staining experiments were performed. To validate the in vivo studies we used human APP Swedish (swe)/Indiana (ind)-overexpressing neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells which were subjected to knockdown of AdipoR1 and APMK with siRNAs treated with Os-pep and other conditions as per the mechanistic approach and we proceeded to perform further biochemical analyses. RESULTS: Our in vitro and in vivo results show that Os-pep has good safety and neuroprotection profiles and crosses the blood-brain barrier. We found reduced levels of neuronal AdipoR1 in human AD brain tissue. Os-pep stimulates AdipoR1 and its downstream target AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling in AD and Adipo-/- mice. Mechanistically in all of the in vivo and in vitro studies Os-pep rescued aberrant neuronal metabolism by reducing neuronal insulin resistance and activated downstream insulin signaling through regulation of AdipoR1/AMPK signaling to consequently improve the memory functions of the AD and Adipo-/- mice which was associated with improved synaptic function and long-term potentiation via an AdipoR1-dependent mechanism. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that Os-pep activates AdipoR1/AMPK signaling and regulates neuronal insulin resistance and insulin signaling which subsequently rescues memory deficits in AD and adiponectin-deficient models. Taken together the results indicate that Os-pep as an adiponectin-mimetic novel nonapeptide is a valuable and promising potential therapeutic candidate to treat aberrant brain metabolism associated with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.,NA,"Division of Applied Life Science (BK 21 Four) College of Natural Science Gyeongsang National University Jinju 52828 Republic of Korea.Department of Physiology College of Medicine Yonsei University Seoul 120-752 Republic of Korea.Department of Biology The University of Texas at San Antonio San Antonio USA.Translational Neuroscience and Psychiatry School for Mental Health and Neuroscience (MHeNs) Maastricht University Medical Centre Maastricht Netherlands.Division of Applied Life Science (BK 21 Four) College of Natural Science Gyeongsang National University Jinju 52828 Republic of Korea. mokim@gnu.ac.kr.",2021,10.1186/s13024-021-00445-4,,,,pubmed-33849621,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Included,Included

The stress-induced activation of the p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) leads to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and neurodegeneration. We investigated the effects of an isoform selective p38α MAPK inhibitor MW01-18-150SRM (MW150) administered at 2.5 mg/kg/d (i.p.; 14 days) on early entorhinal cortex (EC) alterations in an AD mouse model carrying human mutations of the amyloid precursor protein (mhAPP). We used electrophysiological analyses with long-term potentiation induction in EC-containing brain slices and EC-relevant associative memory tasks. We found that MW150 was capable of rescuing long-term potentiation in 2-month old mhAPP mice. Acute delivery of MW150 to brain slices was similarly effective in rescuing long-term potentiation with a comparable efficacy to that of the widely used multikinase inhibitor SB203580. MW150-treated mhAPP mice demonstrated improved ability to discriminate novel associations between objects and their position/context.

H.Pirzad Jahromi G.Mohammadi A.Sahraei H ",Synapse,Synapse,Extracellular beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation and deposition is the main factor which causes synaptic loss and eventually cells death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Memory loss and long-term potentiation (LTP) dysfunction in the hippocampus are involved in the AD. The involvement of crocin as the main and active constituent of saffron extract in learning and memory processes has been proposed. Here we investigated the probable therapeutic effect of crocin on memory LTP and neuronal apoptosis using in vivo Abeta models of the AD. The Abeta peptide (1-42) was bilaterally administered into the frontal-cortex using stereotaxic apparatus. Five hours post-surgery rats were given intra-peritoneal crocin (30mg/kg) daily which repeated for 12 days. Barnes maze results showed that administration of crocin signi fi cantly improve spatial memory indicators such as latency time to achieving the target hole and the number of errors when compared to Abeta-group. Passive avoidance test revealed that crocin significantly increased the step-through-latency compared to Abeta-treated alone. These learning deficits in Abeta-treated animals correlated with a reduction of LTP in hippocampal CA1 synapses in freely moving rats which crocin improved population spike amplitude and mean field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) slope reduction induced by Abeta. Neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay and the expression levels of c-Fos proteins were examined by Western blotting. Crocin signi fi cantly reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the CA1 region and decreased c-Fos in the hippocampus compared to Abeta-group. In vivo Abeta treatment altered significantly the electrophysiological properties of CA1 neurons and crocin further confirm a neuroprotective action against Abeta toxicity.

Results: We revealed that Lcn2 mRNA and protein levels were greatly increased in mouse hippocampal neurons after surgery. This surgery-induced elevation of LCN2 was independent of the presence of microglia. Gain of function by intracranial injection of rLCN2 protein into hippocampus disrupted fear memory in naive mice without surgery.

J.Choe Y.Lee M. H.Hwang J. Y.Kim J. G.Kim T ",Transl Neurodegener,Transl Neurodegener,BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tauopathy. Reducing Aβ has been considered a major AD treatment strategy in pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Impairment of gamma oscillations which play an important role in perception and cognitive function has been shown in mouse AD models and human patients. Recently the therapeutic effect of gamma entrainment in AD mouse models has been reported. Given that ultrasound is an emerging neuromodulation modality we investigated the effect of ultrasound stimulation pulsed at gamma frequency (40 Hz) in an AD mouse model. METHODS: We implanted electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes and a piezo-ceramic disc ultrasound transducer on the skull surface of 6-month-old 5×FAD and wild-type control mice (n = 12 and 6 respectively). Six 5×FAD mice were treated with two-hour ultrasound stimulation at 40 Hz daily for two weeks and the other six mice received sham treatment. Soluble and insoluble Aβ levels in the brain were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Spontaneous EEG gamma power was computed by wavelet analysis and the brain connectivity was examined with phase-locking value and cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling. RESULTS: We found that the total Aβ42 levels especially insoluble Aβ42 in the treatment group decreased in pre- and infra-limbic cortex (PIL) compared to that of the sham treatment group. A reduction in the number of Aβ plaques was also observed in the hippocampus. There was no increase in microbleeding in the transcranial ultrasound stimulation (tUS) group. In addition the length and number of microglial processes decreased in PIL and hippocampus. Encelphalographic spontaneous gamma power was increased and cross-frequency coupling was normalized implying functional improvement after tUS stimulation. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the transcranial ultrasound-based gamma-band entrainment technique can be an effective therapy for AD by reducing the Aβ load and improving brain connectivity.,NA,"Department of Biomedical Science and Engineering Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology Gwangju 61005 Republic of Korea.Korea Brain Research Institute Daegu 41062 Republic of Korea.Department of Information and Communication Engineering Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology Daegu 42988 Republic of Korea.Department of Biomedical Science and Engineering Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology Gwangju 61005 Republic of Korea. jaekim@gist.ac.kr.Department of Biomedical Science and Engineering Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology Gwangju 61005 Republic of Korea. tae-kim@gist.ac.kr.",2021,10.1186/s40035-021-00274-x,,,,pubmed-34872618,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

Therefore we investigated the effects of hCG on the phosphorylated tau protein level and its effect on hCG receptor-immunoreactive neuron density in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease (AD) model rats (streptozotocin [STZ] injected intracerebroventricularly). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The rats were administered hCG (50 100 and 200 IU/200 µl saline intraperitoneally) or vehicle once/day for three days after injection of STZ. The passive avoidance memory test was performed 6 hours after the last hCG injection. The phosphorylated tau protein level in the hippocampus was measured by ELISA and hCG receptor-immunoreactive neurons were shown by immunohistochemical technique in areas of hippocampus. RESULTS: Treatment with hCG attenuated memory deficiencies and reduced the level of phosphorylated tau protein in the hippocampus. hCG also improved the density of hCG receptor-immunoreactive neurons. The high dose of hCG hormone (200 IU/200 µl saline) seemed to have a significant effect on passive avoidance memory phosphorylated tau protein concentration and accumulation of hCG receptor-immunoreactive neurons in Alzheimeric rats' hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion hCG can provide protection against memory deficits induced by STZ and it can inhibit accumulation of tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus. Furthermore hCG can increase the hCG receptor-ir neurons number in the rats hippocampus after ICV injection of STZ.,NA,NA,2018,10.5114/fn.2018.76619,,,,pubmed-30509034,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b,Laurel Renton,Excluded,Excluded

The entorhinal cortex and the dentate gyrus are important for learning and memory which are affected in the early stages of AD. Since BACE1 is a potential target for AD therapy it is crucial to understand its physiological role in these brain regions. Here we examined the function of BACE1 in the dentate gyrus. We show that loss of BACE1 in the dentate gyrus leads to increased granule cell excitability indicated by enhanced efficiency of synaptic potentials to generate granule cell spikes. The increase in granule cell excitability was accompanied by prolonged paired-pulse inhibition altered network gamma oscillations and impaired synaptic plasticity at entorhinal-dentate synapses of the perforant path. In summary this is the first detailed electrophysiological study of BACE1 deletion at the network level in vivo. The results suggest that BACE1 is important for normal dentate gyrus network function. This has implications for the use of BACE1 inhibitors as therapeutics for AD therapy since BACE1 inhibition could similarly disrupt synaptic plasticity and excitability in the entorhinal-dentate circuitry.,NA,"Institute of Clinical Neuroanatomy Neuroscience Center Goethe University Frankfurt am Main Germany. matej.vnencak@tyks.fi.Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Turku University Hospital University of Turku PL 52 20521 Turku Finland. matej.vnencak@tyks.fi.Ernst Strüngmann Institute (ESI) for Neuroscience in Cooperation with Max Planck Society Frankfurt am Main Germany.Institute of Clinical Neuroanatomy Neuroscience Center Goethe University Frankfurt am Main Germany.BioMedical Center Biochemistry Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich Germany.Institute of Clinical Neuroanatomy Neuroscience Center Goethe University Frankfurt am Main Germany.

Membrane-bound STEP61 is the only isoform expressed in hippocampus and cortex. Genetic deletion of STEP enhances excitatory synaptic currents and long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. However, whether STEP61 affects seizure susceptibility is unclear. Here we investigated the effects of STEP inhibitor TC-2153 on seizure propensity in a murine model displaying kainic acid (KA)–induced status epilepticus and its effect on hippocampal excitability. Methods: Adult male and female C57BL/6J mice received intraperitoneal injection of either vehicle (2.8% dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO] in saline) or TC-2153 (10 mg/kg) and then either saline or KA (30 mg/kg) 3 h later before being monitored for behavioral seizures. A subset of female mice was ovariectomized (OVX). Acute hippocampal slices from Thy1-GCaMP6s mice were treated with either DMSO or TC-2153 (10 μM) for 1 h, and then incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) and potassium chloride (15 mM) for 2 min prior to live calcium imaging. Pyramidal neurons in dissociated rat hippocampal culture (DIV 8–10) were pre-treated with DMSO or TC-2153 (10 µM) for 1 h before whole-cell patch-clamp recording. Results: TC-2153 treatment significantly reduced KA-induced seizure severity, with greater trend seen in female mice. OVX abolished this TC-2153-induced decrease in seizure severity in female mice. TC-2153 application significantly decreased overall excitability of acute hippocampal slices from both sexes. Surprisingly, TC-2153 treatment hyperpolarized resting membrane potential and decreased firing rate, sag voltage, and hyperpolarization-induced current (Ih) of cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Significance: This study is the first to demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of STEP with TC-2153 decreases seizure severity and hippocampal activity in both sexes, and dampens hippocampal neuronal excitability and Ih. We propose that the antiseizure effects of TC-2153 are mediated by its unexpected action on suppressing neuronal intrinsic excitability.",NA,Carle Illinois College of Medicine|Carle Foundation Hospital|School of Molecular and Cellular Biology|University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,2022,10.1111/epi.17192,,,,scopus-2-s2.0-85124888910,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

Forsythoside A (FA), the main constituent of  Forsythia suspensa  (Thunb.) Vahl., possesses anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties. The present study aimed to investigate the potential role of FA in AD neuropathology using male APP/PS1 double transgenic AD mice, Aβ 1-42 -exposed N2a cells, erastin-stimulated HT22 cells, and LPS-induced BV2 cells. FA treatment significantly improved mitochondrial function and inhibited lipid peroxidation in Aβ 1-42 -exposed N2a cells. In LPS-stimulated BV2 cells, FA treatment decreased the formation of the pro-inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-1β, and NO. In male APP/PS1 mice, FA treatment ameliorated memory and cognitive impairments and suppressed Aβ deposition and p-tau levels in the brain. Analyses using proteomics, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and western blot revealed that FA treatment significantly augmented dopaminergic signaling, inhibited iron deposition and lipid peroxidation, prevented the activation of IKK/IκB/NF-κB signaling, reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors, and promoted the production of anti-inflammatory factors in the brain. FA treatment exerted anti-ferroptosis and anti-neuroinflammatory effects in erastin-stimulated HT22 cells, and the Nrf2/GPX4 axis played a key role in these effects.

Human genetic studies have shown that the loss-of-function mutations in TREM2 signaling are strongly associated with an elevated risk of age-related neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous studies have investigated the impact of TREM2 deficiency in the pathogenic process of AD. However the role of TREM2 in shaping neuronal and cognitive function during normal aging is underexplored. In the present study we employed behavioral electrophysiological and biochemical approaches to assess cognitive and synaptic function in male and female young and aged TREM2-deficient (Trem2-/-) mice compared with age-matched sex-matched and genetic background-matched wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J controls. Young Trem2-/- mice exhibited normal cognitive function and synaptic plasticity but had increased dendritic spine density compared with young WT. Unexpectedly aged Trem2-/- mice showed superior cognitive performance compared with aged WT controls. Consistent with the behavioral data aged Trem2-/- mice displayed significantly enhanced hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and increased dendritic spine density and synaptic markers compared with aged WT mice.

SUMOylation has been suggested to play a role in the amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology of Alzheimer disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative diseases. The current study examines the impact of SUMO1 on processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to the production and deposition of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. An in vivo model of these pathways was developed by the generation of double transgenic mice over-expressing human SUMO1 and a mutant APP. The SUMO1-APP transgenics displayed normal APP processing but at later ages exhibited increased insoluble Abeta and plaque density accompanied by increased dendritic spine loss more pronounced synaptic and cognitive deficits. These findings suggest a potential impairment in Abeta clearance as opposed to increased amyloid production. Examination of microglia indicated a reduction in the SUMO1-APP transgenics which is a possible mechanism for the SUMO1-mediated increase in amyloid load.

In the present study, 3-month-old male APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice and C57BL/6 wild-type mice were randomly divided into sedentary (SED) or exercise (EX) group, twelve mice in each group. Mice in exercise groups were subjected to ran on a treadmill for 3 months, 5 days/week. Afterwards, the spatial learning and memory, hippocampal fibrillar Aβ deposits and microglial functions were determined by Morris water maze task, methoxy-X04 staining as well as in vivo and in vitro assays, respectively. The results showed that 3 months of treadmill exercise largely prevented spatial learning and memory decline and alleviated hippocampal methoxy-X04-positive fibrillar Aβ deposits in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, treadmill exercise partly restored microglial Aβ degradation and clearance in the hippocampus, which was impaired in APP/PS1 mice. However, the impaired microglial Aβ phagocytosis in APP/PS1 mice was not altered after 3 months of treadmill exercise intervention. These findings demonstrate that 3 months of treadmill exercise alleviates hippocampal Aβ deposition and restores spatial learning and memory in APP/PS1 mice, partly by promoting microglial Aβ degradation and clearance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35398179,GanNan Normal University|East China Normal University|Anhui Normal University,2022,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2022.03.043,,,,pubmed-35398179,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b,Laurel Renton,Excluded,Excluded

M ",Front Pharmacol,Front Pharmacol,Kyotorphin (KTP l-tyrosyl-l-arginine) is an endogenous dipeptide initially described to have analgesic properties. Recently KTP was suggested to be an endogenous neuroprotective agent namely for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In fact KTP levels were shown to be decreased in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with AD and recent data showed that intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of KTP ameliorates memory impairments in a sporadic rat model of AD. However this administration route is far from being a suitable therapeutic strategy. Here we evaluated if the blood-brain permeant KTP-derivative KTP-NH(2) when systemically administered would be effective in preventing memory deficits in a sporadic AD animal model and if so which would be the synaptic correlates of that action. The sporadic AD model was induced in male Wistar rats through i.c.v. injection of amyloid β peptide (Aβ). Animals were treated for 20 days with KTP-NH(2) (32.3 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) starting at day 3 after Aβ administration) before memory testing (Novel object recognition (NOR) and Y-maze (YM) tests). Animals were then sacrificed and markers for gliosis were assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Synaptic correlates were assessed by evaluating theta-burst induced long term potentiation (LTP) of field excitatory synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) recorded from hippocampal slices and cortical spine density analysis. In the absence of KTP-NH(2) treatment Aβ-injected rats had clear memory deficits as assessed through NOR or YM tests. Importantly these memory deficits were absent in Aβ-injected rats that had been treated with KTP-NH(2) which scored in memory tests as control (sham i.c.v. injected) rats. No signs of gliosis could be detected at the end of the treatment in any group of animals. LTP magnitude was significantly impaired in hippocampal slices that had been incubated with Aβ oligomers (200 nM) in the absence of KTP-NH(2). Co-incubation with KTP-NH(2) (50 nM) rescued LTP toward control values. Similarly Aβ caused a significant decrease in spine density in cortical neuronal cultures and this was prevented by co-incubation with KTP-NH(2) (50 nM). In conclusion the present data demonstrate that i.p. KTP-NH(2) treatment counteracts Aβ-induced memory impairments in an AD sporadic model possibly through the rescuing of synaptic plasticity mechanisms.,NA,"Instituto de Farmacologia e Neurociências Faculdade de Medicina Universidade de Lisboa Lisbon Portugal.Instituto de Medicina Molecular João Lobo Antunes Faculdade de Medicina Universidade de Lisboa Lisbon Portugal.Cardiovascular Autonomic Function Lab Centro Cardiovascular da Universidade de Lisboa Lisbon Portugal.Instituto de Bioquímica Faculdade de Medicina Universidade de Lisboa Lisbon Portugal.CEDOC Chronic Diseases Research Center NOVA Medical School Faculdade de Ciências Médicas Universidade Nova de Lisboa Lisboa Portugal.Department of Experimental Neurodegeneration Center for Biostructural Imaging of Neurodegeneration University Medical Center Göttingen Göttingen Germany.Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine Göttingen Germany.Translational and Clinical Research Institute Faculty of Medical Sciences Newcastle University Framlington Place Newcastle Upon Tyne United Kingdom.Laboratori d'Innovació en Processos i Productes de Síntesi Orgànica (LIPPSO) Departament de Química Universitat de Girona Girona Spain.",2020,10.3389/fphar.2020.00985,,,,pubmed-32733240,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Included,Included

Accumulating data indicate middle age as a critical period for the relevant pathological processes however the question of when AD starts to develop remains open. It has been reported only recently that in the early postnatal period-when brain development is completing-preconditions for a decrease in cognitive abilities and for accelerated aging can form. Here we hypothesized that specific features of early postnatal brain development may be considered some of the prerequisites of AD development at an advanced age. To test this hypothesis we used OXYS rats which are a suitable model of sporadic AD. The duration of gestation litter size and weight at birth were lower in OXYS rats compared to control Wistar rats. The shortened duration of gestation may result in developmental retardation. Indeed we noted decreased locomotor activity and increased anxiety in OXYS rats already at a young age: possible signs of altered brain development. We demonstrated retardation of the peak of postnatal neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of OXYS rats. Delayed neuronal maturation led to alterations of mossy-fiber formation: a shortened suprapyramidal bundle and longer infrapyramidal bundle less pronounced fasciculation of granule cells' axons and smaller size and irregular shape of nuclei in the CA3 pyramidal layer. These changes were accompanied by altered astrocytic migration. The observed features of early development may be considered some of the risk factors of the AD-like pathology that manifests itself in OXYS rats late in life.,NA,"Laboratory of Molecular Mechanisms of Aging The Federal Research Center Institute of Cytology and Genetics Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (SB RAS) Novosibirsk Russia.Laboratory of Central Mechanisms of Regulation Institute of Molecular Biology and Biophysics Federal Research Center of Fundamental and Translational Medicine Novosibirsk Russia.",2020,10.3389/fnins.2020.00533,,,,pubmed-32581685,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

Here we first assessed and compared the performance of cognition and synaptic plasticity in young (3-5-month old) and aged c57BL/6J mice (19-21 months old). Findings from behavioral tests demonstrated that old mice compared to young mice displayed impairments in spatial learning/memory working memory and behavioral flexibility. Further synaptic electrophysiology experiments on hippocampal slices revealed that the early form of long-term potentiation (LTP a synaptic model for memory formation) was inhibited in old mice. At the molecular level biochemical assays on the hippocampus showed dysregulation of signaling pathways controlling protein synthesis capacity including: up-regulation of AKT-mTORC1-p70S6K signaling which is associated with translation of terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) class of mRNAs that encode translational machinery; hyper-phosphorylation of mRNA translational elongation factor 2 (eEF2) and its upstream regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) indicating repression of general protein synthesis. Moreover young and old mice exhibited similar brain levels of translational initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation which is known to be increased in AD and linked to the disease pathophysiology.

Vice versa, treating aged mice with young blood plasma rescues impairments associated with aging. Whether blood-borne factors are sufficient to drive impairments outside the dentate gyrus, how they impact neurophysiology, and how the functional outcome compares to impairments found in mouse models for AD is still unclear. Here, we treated adult mice with blood plasma from aged mice and assessed neurophysiological parameters in the hippocampal CA1. Mice treated with aged blood plasma show significantly impaired levels of long-term potentiation (LTP), similar to those present in APP/PS1 mice.

Administration of the immunotoxin 192IgG-saporin to rats an animal model of AD leads to degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the medial septal area. In the present study cholinergic cell death was induced by intracerebroventricular administration of 192IgG-saporin. One and a half months after injection we studied the histopathology of the hippocampus and the responses of microglia and astrocytes using immunohistochemistry and neuroglial gene expression. We found that treatment with 192IgG-saporin resulted in neuronal loss in the CA3 field of the hippocampus. Microglial proliferation was observed in the dentate gyrus of the dorsal hippocampus and white matter. Massive proliferation and activation of microglia in the white matter was associated with strong activation of astrocytes. However the expression of microglial marker genes significantly increased only in the dorsal hippocampus not the ventral hippocampus. These effects were not related to non-specific action of 192IgG-saporin because of the absence of the Nerve growth factor receptor in the hippocampus. Additionally 192IgG-saporin treatment also induced a decrease in the expression of genes that are associated with transport functions of brain vascular cells (Slc22a8 Ptprb Sdpr) again in the dorsal hippocampus but not in the ventral hippocampus.

In this study the effects of KVN93 an inhibitor of dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase-1A (DYRK1A) on cognitive function and A beta plaque levels and the underlying mechanism of action were evaluated in 5x FAD mice (a mouse model of AD). KVN93 treatment significantly improved long-term memory by enhancing dendritic synaptic function.

Salvo;Sidhanth Chandra;Tom N. Grammatopoulos;Craig J. Justman;Peter T. Lansbury;Joseph R. Mazzulli;Robert Vassar,MOLECULAR NEURODEGENERATION,NA,"AbstractBackgroundAmyloid plaque deposition and axonal degeneration are early events in AD pathogenesis. Aβ disrupts microtubules in presynaptic dystrophic neurites, resulting in the accumulation of impaired endolysosomal and autophagic organelles transporting β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1). Consequently, dystrophic neurites generate Aβ42 and significantly contribute to plaque deposition. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) have recently been investigated for repositioning toward the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and block the action of farnesyltransferase (FTase) to catalyze farnesylation, a post-translational modification that regulates proteins involved in lysosome function and microtubule stability. In postmortem AD brains, FTase and its downstream signaling are upregulated. However, the impact of FTIs on amyloid pathology and dystrophic neurites is unknown.MethodsWe tested the effects of the FTIs LNK-754 and lonafarnib in the 5XFAD mouse model of amyloid pathology.ResultsIn 2-month-old 5XFAD mice treated chronically for 3 months, LNK-754 reduced amyloid plaque burden, tau hyperphosphorylation, and attenuated the accumulation of BACE1 and LAMP1  in dystrophic neurites. In 5-month-old 5XFAD mice treated acutely for 3 weeks, LNK-754 reduced dystrophic neurite size and LysoTracker-Green accumulation in the absence of effects on Aβ deposits. Acute treatment with LNK-754 improved memory and learning deficits in hAPP/PS1 amyloid mice. In contrast to LNK-754, lonafarnib treatment was less effective at reducing plaques, tau hyperphosphorylation and dystrophic neurites, which could have resulted from reduced potency against FTase compared to LNK-754. We investigated the effects of FTIs on axonal trafficking of endolysosomal organelles and found that lonafarnib and LNK-754 enhanced retrograde axonal transport in primary neurons, indicating FTIs could support the maturation of axonal late endosomes into lysosomes. Furthermore, FTI treatment increased levels of LAMP1 in mouse primary neurons and in the brains of 5XFAD mice, demonstrating that FTIs stimulated the biogenesis of endolysosomal organelles.ConclusionsWe show new data to suggest that LNK-754 promoted the axonal trafficking and function of endolysosomal compartments, which we hypothesize decreased axonal dystrophy, reduced BACE1 accumulation and inhibited amyloid deposition in 5XFAD mice.

Astrocytes are well positioned at the neuronal synapse to capture and degrade extracellular tau as it transits the synapse and hence could potentially have the ability to inhibit tau spreading and delay disease progression. Our study shows increased expression and activity of Transcription Factor EB (TFEB) a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis in response to tau pathology in both human brains with dementia and transgenic mouse models. Exogenous TFEB expression in primary astrocytes enhances tau fibril uptake and lysosomal activity while TFEB knockout has the reverse effect. In vivo induced TFEB expression in astrocytes reduces pathology in the hippocampus of PS19 tauopathy mice as well as prominently attenuates tau spreading from the ipsilateral to the contralateral hippocampus in a mouse model of tau spreading.

Oral frailty has been proposed as a novel frailty phenotype and is defined as a decrease in oral function coexisting with a decline in cognitive and physical functions. Oral frailty has received particular attention in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the pathomechanisms of oral frailty related to AD remain unknown. It is assumed that the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (Vmes), which controls mastication, is affected by AD pathology, and as a result, masticatory function may be impaired. To investigate this possibility, we included male 3 × Tg-AD mice and their non-transgenic counterpart (NonTg) of 3-4 months of age in the present study. Immunohistochemistry revealed amyloid-β deposition and excessive tau phosphorylation in the Vmes of 3 × Tg-AD mice. Furthermore, vesicular glutamate transporter 1-immunopositive axon varicosities, which are derived from Vmes neurons, were significantly reduced in the trigeminal motor nucleus of 3 × Tg-AD mice. To investigate whether the AD pathology observed in the Vmes affects masticatory function, we analyzed electromyography of the masseter muscle during feeding. The 3 × Tg-AD mice showed a significant delay in masticatory rhythm compared to NonTg mice. Furthermore, we developed a system to simultaneously record bite force and electromyography of masseter, and devised a new method to estimate bite force during food chewing in mice. Since the muscle activity of the masseter showed a high correlation with bite force, it could be accurately estimated from the muscle activity. The estimated bite force of 3 × Tg-AD mice eating sunflower seeds was predominantly smaller than that of NonTg mice. However, there was no difference in masseter weight or muscle fiber cross-sectional area between the two groups, suggesting that the decreased bite force and delayed mastication rhythm observed in 3 × Tg-AD mice were not due to abnormality of the masseter. In conclusion, the decreased masticatory function observed in 3 × Tg-AD mice was most likely caused by AD pathology in the Vmes. Thus, novel quantitative analyses of masticatory function using the mouse model of AD enabled a comprehensive understanding of oral frailty pathogenesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35983379,NA,2022,10.3389/fnagi.2022.935033,,,,pubmed-35983379,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b,Laurel Renton,Excluded,Excluded

S ",Iran Biomed J,Iran Biomed J,BACKGROUND: The most important cause of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress. Probiotics are microorganisms that are believed to be beneficial to human and animals. Probiotics reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in some cases. Therefore this study determined the effects of probiotics mixture on the biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation in an AD model of rats. METHODS: In this study 50 rats were allocated to five groups namely control sham and AD groups with Aβ1-40 intra-hippocampal injection as well as AD + rivastigmine and AD + probiotics groups with Aβ1-40 intra-hippocampal injection and 2 ml (1010 CFU) of probiotics (Lactobacillus reuteri Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium infantis) orally once a day for 10 weeks. MWM was used to assess memory and learning. To detect Aβ plaque Congo red staining was used. Oxidative stress was monitored by measuring the MDA level and SOD activity and to assess inflammation markers (IL-1β and TNF-α) in the hippocampus ELISA method was employed.. RESULTS: Spatial memory improved significantly in treatment group as measured by MWM. Probiotics administration reduced Aβ plaques in AD rats. MDA decreased and SOD increased in the treatment group. Besides probiotics reduced IL-1β and TNF-α as inflammation markers in the AD model of rats. CONCLUSION: Our data revealed that probiotics are helpful in attenuating inflammation and oxidative stress in AD.,NA,"Department of Physiology School of Medicine Tehran University of Medical Sciences Tehran Iran.Electrophysiology Research Center Neuroscience Institute Tehran University of Medical Sciences Tehran Iran.",2020,10.29252/ibj.24.4.220,,,,pubmed-32306720,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b,Laurel Renton,Excluded,Excluded

However, given that ultrasound can operate over a wide range of parameters that can all be modulated, its applicability extends far beyond the bioimaging field. In fact, the modality has emerged as a hybrid technology that effectively assists drug delivery by transiently opening the blood-brain barrier (BBB) when combined with intravenously injected microbubbles, and facilitates neuromodulation. Studies in aged mice contributed to an insight into how low-intensity ultrasound brings about its neuromodulatory effects, including increased synaptic plasticity and improved cognitive functions, with a potential role for neurogenesis and the modulation of NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal signalling. This work is complemented by studies in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a form of pathological ageing.

The objective of this paper was to study epigenetic mechanisms of EDR and KED peptides' neuroprotective effects on neuroplasticity and dendritic spine morphology in an AD mouse model. Daily intraperitoneal administration of the KED peptide in 5xFAD mice from 2 to 4 months of age at a concentration of 400 μg/kg tended to increase neuroplasticity. KED and EDR peptides prevented dendritic spine loss in 5xFAD-M mice. Their action's possible molecular mechanisms were investigated by molecular modeling and docking of peptides in dsDNA containing all possible combinations of hexanucleotide sequences. Similar DNA sequences were found in the lowest-energy complexes of the studied peptides with DNA in the classical B-form. EDR peptide has binding sites in the promoter region of CASP3 NES GAP43 APOE SOD2 PPARA PPARG GDX1 genes. Protein products of these genes are involved in AD pathogenesis.

However little is known on the role of COX5A in the development and progress of Alzheimer's disease (Martinez-Losa et al. 2018). In this study we established and characterized the genomic profiles of genes expressed in the hippocampus of Senescence-Accelerated Mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice and revealed differential expression of COX5A among 12-month-aged SAMP8 mice and 2-month-aged SAMP8 mice. Newly established transgenic mice with systemic COX5A overexpression (51% increase) resulted in the improvement of spatial recognition memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity recovery of hippocampal CA1 dendrites and activation of the BDNF/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in vivo. Moreover mice with both COX5A overexpression and BDNF knockdown showed a poor recovery in spatial recognition memory as well as a decrease in spine density and branching of dendrites in CA1 when compared to mice that only overexpressed COX5A. In vitro studies supported that COX5A affected neuronal growth via BDNF.

However apoE4 may cause innate brain abnormalities before the appearance of AD-related neuropathology. Understanding these primary dysfunctions is vital for the early detection of AD and the development of therapeutic strategies. Recently we reported impaired extra-hippocampal memory in young apoE4 mice a deficit that was correlated with attenuated structural pre-synaptic plasticity in cortical and subcortical regions. Here we tested the hypothesis that these early structural deficits impact learning via changes in basal and stimuli evoked neuronal activity. We recorded extracellular neuronal activity from the gustatory cortex (GC) of three-month-old humanized apoE4 (hApoE4) and wildtype rats expressing rat apoE (rAE) before and after conditioned taste aversion (CTA) training. Despite normal sucrose drinking behavior before CTA young hApoE4 rats showed impaired CTA learning consistent with our previous results in target-replacement apoE4 mice. This behavioral deficit was correlated with decreased basal and taste-evoked firing rates in both putative excitatory and inhibitory GC neurons. Further taste coding analyses at the single neuron and ensemble levels revealed that GC neurons of the hApoE4 group correctly classified tastes but were unable to undergo plasticity to support learning. These results suggest that apoE4 impacts brain excitability and plasticity early in life that may act as an initiator for later AD pathologies.,NA,"Sagol School of Neuroscience Tel Aviv University Tel Aviv 6997801 Israel.Department of Neurobiology The School of Neurobiology Biochemistry and Biophysics The George S.

However, the effect of Rhizoma Gastrodiae water extract (WERG) on AD and the detailed mechanism of action remain unclear. In this study, the mechanism of action of WERG was investigated by the microbiome-gut-brain axis using a D-galactose (D-gal)/AlCl 3 -induced AD mouse model. WERG improved the cognitive impairment of D-gal/AlCl 3 -induced mice. The expression level of p-Tau thr231  in the WERG-H treatment group was decreased, and p-Tau thr231  was found negative in hippocampal DG, CA1, and CA3 regions. Here, the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota were analyzed by 16sRNA sequencing. WERG-H treatment had a positive correlation with Firmicutes, Bacilli,  Lactobacillus johnsonii ,  Lactobacillus murinus , and  Lactobacillus reuteri . Interestingly, the Rikenellaceae-RC9 gut group in the gut increased in D-gal/AlCl 3 -induced mice, but the increased  L. johnsonii ,  L. murinus , and  L. reuteri  reversed this process. This may be a potential mechanistic link between gut microbiota dysbiosis and P-Tau Thr231  levels in AD progression.

H ",Front Mol Neurosci,Front Mol Neurosci,Dysbiosis of gut microbiota is strongly associated with metabolic diseases including diabetes mellitus obesity and cardiovascular disease. Recent studies indicate that Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) a gut microbe-dependent metabolite is implicated in the development of age-related cognitive decline. However the mechanisms of the impact of TMAO on neuronal function has not been elucidated. In the current study we investigated the relationship between TMAO and deficits in synaptic plasticity in an Alzheimer's model (3×Tg-AD) and insulin resistance (Leptin deficient db/db) mouse by measuring plasma and brain levels of TMAO. We observed increased TMAO levels in the plasma and brain of both db/db and 3×Tg-AD mice in comparison to wild-type mice. Besides TMAO levels further increased as mice progressed in age. Deficits in synaptic plasticity in the form of reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) were noted in both groups of mice in comparison to wild-type mice. To further explore the impact of TMAO on neuronal function we utilized an ex-vivo model by incubating wild-type hippocampal brain slices with TMAO and found impaired synaptic transmission. We observed that TMAO induced the PERK-EIF2α-ER stress signaling axis in TMAO treated ex-vivo slices as well as in both db/db and 3×Tg-AD mice. Lastly we also observed altered presynaptic and reduced postsynaptic receptor expression. Our findings suggest that TMAO may induce deficits in synaptic plasticity through the ER stress-mediated PERK signaling pathway.

D.Beaulieu-Abdelahad D.Blair L. J ",Acta Neuropathol Commun,Acta Neuropathol Commun,The microtubule associated protein tau is an intrinsically disordered phosphoprotein that accumulates under pathological conditions leading to formation of neurofibrillary tangles a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mechanisms that initiate the accumulation of phospho-tau aggregates and filamentous deposits are largely unknown. In the past our work and others' have shown that molecular chaperones play a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis and that imbalance in their levels or activity can drive tau pathogenesis. We have found two co-chaperones of the 90 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) FK506-binding protein 52 (FKBP52) and the activator of Hsp90 ATPase homolog 1 (Aha1) promote tau aggregation in vitro and in the brains of tau transgenic mice. Based on this we hypothesized that increased levels of these chaperones could promote tau misfolding and accumulation in the brains of aged wild-type mice. We tested this hypothesis by overexpressing Aha1 FKBP52 or mCherry (control) proteins in the hippocampus of 9-month-old wild-type mice. After 7 months of expression mice were evaluated for cognitive and pathological changes. Our results show that FKBP52 overexpression impaired spatial reversal learning while Aha1 overexpression impaired associative learning in aged wild-type mice. FKBP52 and Aha1 overexpression promoted phosphorylation of distinct AD-relevant tau species. Furthermore FKBP52 activated gliosis and promoted neuronal loss leading to a reduction in hippocampal volume. Glial activation and phospho-tau accumulation were also detected in areas adjacent to the hippocampus including the entorhinal cortex suggesting that after initiation these pathologies can propagate through other brain regions.

K.Westi E. W.Diaz-delCastillo M.Tanila H.Schousboe A.Aldana B. I.Waagepetersen H. S ",Neurobiol Dis,Neurobiol Dis,Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to cerebral accumulation of insoluble amyloid-β plaques causing synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Neurons rely on astrocyte-derived glutamine for replenishment of the amino acid neurotransmitter pools. Perturbations of astrocyte glutamine synthesis have been described in AD but whether this functionally affects neuronal neurotransmitter synthesis is not known. Since the synthesis and recycling of neurotransmitter glutamate and GABA are intimately coupled to cellular metabolism the aim of this study was to provide a functional investigation of neuronal and astrocytic energy and neurotransmitter metabolism in AD. To achieve this we incubated acutely isolated cerebral cortical and hippocampal slices from 8-month-old female 5xFAD mice in the presence of (13)C isotopically enriched substrates with subsequent gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. A prominent neuronal hypometabolism of [U-(13)C]glucose was observed in the hippocampal slices of the 5xFAD mice. Investigating astrocyte metabolism using [12-(13)C]acetate revealed a marked reduction in glutamine synthesis which directly hampered neuronal synthesis of GABA. This was supported by an increased metabolism of exogenously supplied [U-(13)C]glutamine suggesting a neuronal metabolic compensation of the reduced astrocytic glutamine supply. In contrast astrocytic metabolism of [U-(13)C]GABA was reduced whereas [U-(13)C]glutamate metabolism was unaffected. Finally astrocyte de novo synthesis of glutamate and glutamine was hampered whereas the enzymatic capacity of glutamine synthetase for ammonia fixation was maintained. Collectively we demonstrate that deficient astrocyte metabolism leads to reduced glutamine synthesis directly impairing neuronal GABA synthesis in the 5xFAD brain. These findings suggest that astrocyte metabolic dysfunction may be fundamental for the imbalances of synaptic excitation and inhibition in the AD brain.,NA,"Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences University of Copenhagen Denmark.

Once LTP is induced synaptic plasticity becomes nondecaying by the activation of kinases and new protein synthesis [1]. If LTP potentiated by applying low frequencies shortly after its induction synaptic plasticity returns to its original state with decaying by over the time. It is well known that some kinases and phosphatases which are involved in the induction of synaptic plasticity probably modulate tau phosphorylation [24]. However how depression of potentiated synaptic strength contributes to tau phosphorylation in vivo is unclear because of the lack of experiments in which depotentiation of LTP was induced. This study was aimed to investigate the effect of tau protein and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1/2) activation in hippocampus on long-term plastic changes [3]. Method(s): It was used 2-month-old male Wistar albino rats. The rats were divided into 2 groups (n = 10 for each group) as a neutral protocol at 0.033Hz and depotentiation groups. Field potentials consisting of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) and population spike (PS) were recorded from the dentate gyrus in response to the perforant pathway stimulation. To induce long-term potentiation (LTP) high frequency stimulation (HFS) consisting of four trains of 100 pulses at 100 Hz (tetanus) was used while for depotentiation of LTP low frequency stimulation (LFS) consisting of 900 pulses at 1 Hz was applied 5 min after tetanization. In other experiments a neutral protocol at 0.033Hz was applied throughout the experiment without any induction of synaptic plasticity. After recording hippocampi were extracted and total tau (p-tau) phosphorylated tau proteins and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) were measured using western blotting technique. The results were analyzed with independent T-test method. Result(s): 1-Hz depotentiation protocol was able to decrease fEPSP slope which was previously increased by HFS whereas no significant change in fEPSP slope and PS amplitude was observed in neutral protocol experiments. Western blot experiments indicated that tau protein was hyperphosphorylated at ser416 epitope but rather hypophosphorylated at thr231 epitope in the whole hippocampus upon depotentiation of LTP. These changes concomitantly occurred with a notable increase in the levels of total Tau and in the levels of phosphorylated form of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1/2). Discussion(s): These findings indicate that some forms of long-term plastic changes might be related with epitope specific tau phosphorylation and ERK 1/2 activation in the hippocampus [3]. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the deposition of intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Tau hyperphosphorylation has been attributed in part to the deregulation of kinases and phosphatases activities. ERK 1/2 were reported to be activated in the first stages of Alzheimer's disease and were proposed as a potential therapeutic target [5]. Therefore we emphasize that tau may be crucial for physiological learning as well as Alzheimer's disease pathology.Copyright © 2018,https://www.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&AN=2001446191https://ed.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44UOE_INST/44UOE_INST:44UOE_VU2?sid=OVID:embase&id=pmid:&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.euroneuro.2018.11.896&issn=0924-977X&isbn=&volume=29&issue=Supplement+1&spage=S608&pages=S608-S609&date=2019&title=European+Neuropsychopharmacology&atitle=Depotentiation+of+long-term+potentiation+is+associated+with+epitope+specific+tau+hyper%2Fhypo+phosphorylation+in+the+hippocampus+of+adult+rats&aulast=Delibas,"(Delibas Tan Suer) Erciyes University School of Medicine Physiology Kayseri TurkeyS.

Stress has been implicated in many psychiatric disorders, and these disorders are characterized by impairments in cognitive function. Until now, there are no experimental data available on the regulatory effect of TIP60 in acute stress and depression. There is also no definitive explanation on which specific modulation of target gene expression is achieved by TIP60. Here, we identify TIP60 as a novel positive regulator in response to acute restraint stress (ARS) and a potentially effective target of antidepressants. Firstly, we discovered increased hippocampal TIP60 expressions in the ARS model. Furthermore, using the TIP60 inhibitor, MG149, we proved that TIP60 function correlates with behavioral and synaptic activation in the two-hour ARS. Secondly, the lentivirus vector (LV)-TIP60 overexpression (OE)  was injected into the hippocampus prior to the chronic restraint stress (CRS) experiments and it was found that over-expressed TIP60 compensates for TIP60 decrease and improves depression index in CRS. Thirdly, through the intervention of TIP60 expression in vitro, we established the genetic regulation of TIP60 on synaptic proteins, confirmed the TIP60 function as a specific coactivator for PPARγ and found that the PPARγ-mediated TIP60 function modulates transcriptional activation of synaptic proteins. Finally, the LV-TIP60 OE  and PPARγ antagonist, GW9662, were both administered in the CRS model and the data indicated that blocking PPARγ significantly weakened the protective effect of TIP60 against the CRS-induced depression. Conclusively, these findings together support TIP60 as a novel positive factor in response to acute stress and interacts with PPARγ to modulate the pathological mechanism of CRS-induced depression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35114329,NA,2022,10.1016/j.bbi.2022.01.022,,,,pubmed-35114329,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b,Laurel Renton,Included,Included

P.David I.Prevot T ",Neuropsychopharmacology,Neuropsychopharmacology,Background: Reduced GABAergic function is a well-replicated finding in depression schizophrenia other brain diseases such as Alzheimer's and during normal aging with evidence spanning multiple biological scales in live subject and post-mortem brain studies (PMID:28697889). Further studies have shown that GABAergic deficits occur ahead of glutamatergic changes and that the somatostatin (SST)-positive interneuron subtype is selectively vulnerable (PMID:30449530). SST+ GABAergic interneurons inhibit the distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons hence gating excitatory input largely through ionotropic alpha5-containing GABAA receptors (a5-GABAA-R) exclusively located in this cellular compartment in cortical layers and hippocampus. Hence GL-II-73 a novel imidazobenzodiazepine molecule with preferential efficacy at augmenting a5-GABAA-R function displays anxiolytic antidepressant and procognitive efficacies in adult mice stress models or during normal aging (PMID:31192221). The proposed mechanism is through regulating defective excitation-inhibition balance. In these studies we began testing whether these behavioral effects extend to restoring neuroplasticity and neurogenic deficiencies observed in stress conditions or during aging. Method(s): Neuroplasticity studies. Young (2 month) and old (22 months) C57B6 mice received water or GL-II-73 treatment in drinking water (30mg/kg) for 2 months. Mice were assessed for working memory deficits using the Y-maze test. In the aging cohort brains were harvested after chronic treatment (2months) and stained using Golgi-Cox technique (n = 4 mice/group; n = ~40 cells/group 8+ cell/mouse). Dendritic length and spine density were quantified in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus using a stereological approach (NeuroLucida). Neurogenic studies. 129S6/SvEvTac mice were chosen for these initial studies due to their known low neurogenesis levels. 30 8-week old male mice were given GL-II-73 (30mg/kg p.o.) for 28 days and its effects on all adult hippocampal neurogenesis steps (proliferation of newborn cells survival and maturation of newborn neurons) were assessed using standard immuno assays against BrdU KI-67 and DCX. The effects of GL-II-73 were compared to vehicle-treated mice and to fluoxetine-treated animals (18mg/kg/d p.o.; n = 10/group). Result(s): Chronic GL-II-73 treatment in adult mice reversed agerelated impairment in working memory as well as the age-induced reductions in dendritic length and spine number in both prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (p<0.05 vs young; p<0.05 vs old-vehicle treated group). Results were mostly observed in apical dendrites where a5-GABAA-R are located. For neurogenesis GLII73 increased proliferation of progenitor cells increased survival of newborn cells and accelerated maturation of newborn cells in both dorsal and ventral hippocampus (p<0.05 versus vehicle treated). Fluoxetine increased proliferation survival and maturation as previously shown (PMID: 28218311) but variability in response limited comparative analyses across all groups. Conclusion(s): Chronic treatment with GLII73 a novel molecule augmenting a5-GABAA-R function (1) reverses neuronal atrophy naturally occurring during aging and (2) increases all step of hippocampal neurogenesis in adult mice. Current studies are expending these effects to chronic stress models in male and female mice. These results show that GL-II-73 has potential disease-modifying efficacies in addition to its previously-reported therapeutic efficacies (pro-cognitive efficacy antidepressant and anxiolytic properties without sedation).,https://www.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&AN=631799238https://ed.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44UOE_INST/44UOE_INST:44UOE_VU2?sid=OVID:embase&id=pmid:&id=doi:10.1038%2Fs41386-019-0547-9&issn=1740-634X&isbn=&volume=44&issue=Supplement+1&spage=442&pages=442&date=2019&title=Neuropsychopharmacology&atitle=Neurotrophic+and+neurogenic+effects+of+an+alpha5-GABAA+receptor-preferring+positive+allosteric+modulator&aulast=Sibille,"(Sibille Cook Li Knutson Mian Mondal David Guilloux David Prevot) CAMH University of Toronto Toronto CanadaE.

V.Khakh B. S ",Cell Rep,Cell Rep,Astrocytic contributions to neuroinflammation are widely implicated in disease but they remain incompletely explored. We assess medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and visual cortex (VCX) astrocyte and whole-tissue gene expression changes in mice following peripherally induced neuroinflammation triggered by a systemic bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide which produces sickness-related behaviors including anhedonia. Neuroinflammation-mediated behavioral changes and astrocyte-specific gene expression alterations peak when anhedonia is greatest and then reverse to normal. Notably region-specific molecular identities of PFC and VCX astrocytes are largely maintained during reactivity changes. Gene pathway analyses reveal alterations of diverse cell signaling pathways including changes in cell-cell interactions of multiple cell types that may underlie the central effects of neuroinflammation. Certain astrocyte molecular signatures accompanying neuroinflammation are shared with changes reported in Alzheimer's disease and mouse models.

Further to the primary role in protein biosynthesis arginine is involved in the urea cycle and it is a precursor of nitric oxide. Arginine deficiency is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases (AD). In this study we administer arginine intracerebroventricularly in a murine model of AD and evaluate cognitive functions in a set of behavioral tests. In addition the effect of arginine on synaptic plasticity was tested electrophysiologically by assessment of the hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). The effect of arginine on β amyloidosis was tested immunohistochemically. A role of arginine in the prevention of cytotoxicity and apoptosis was evaluated in vitro on PC-12 cells. The results indicate that intracerebroventricular administration of arginine improves spatial memory acquisition in 3xTg-AD mice however without significantly reducing intraneuronal β amyloidosis. Arginine shows little or no impact on LTP and does not rescue LTP deterioration induced by Aβ.

E.Moghadamnia A. A ",Neurotoxicology,Neurotoxicology,In recent years piperine has attracted much attention due to its various biological effects as a neuroprotective agent. Therefore clarification of the possible side effects of piperine is important to identify its potential pharmacological action. Thus the effects of piperine on the long-term plasticity of perforant pathway to dentate gyrus synapses were studied in hippocampus of an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Adult male rats were injected with intracerebroventricular (ICV) streptozotocin (STZ) bilaterally on days 1 and 3 (3 mg/kg). The STZ-injected rats were treated with different doses of piperine for 4 weeks before being used in behavioral electrophysiological and histopathological experiments. The passive-avoidance test was conducted on all animals in order to determine the cognitive performance. Rats were placed in a stereotaxic frame to implant a recording electrode in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and a stimulating electrode in the perforant path. Additionally we assessed the density of survived neurons stained by cresyl violet. In this study chronic administration of piperine low dose improved the ICV-STZ induced learning and long-term potentiation (LTP) impairments with no significant effect on baseline synaptic activity. In contrast remarkable learning and long-term plasticity impairments were observed in rats treated by high dose of piperine in comparison to the other groups. Interestingly this impaired hippocampal LTP was accompanied by an obvious alteration in baseline activity and significantly decreased neuronal numbers within the hippocampus. Therefore our data provides a new understanding of the piperine supplementation effects on hippocampal electrophysiological profile although the consequences may be either beneficial or detrimental.,NA,"Department of Animal Sciences School of Biological Sciences Kharazmi University Tehran Iran.Neuroscience Research Center Health Research Institute and Department of Physiology School of Medicine Babol University of Medical Sciences Babol Iran.

Microglial dysregulation, amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of AD. In the brain, microglia play roles as immune cells to provide protection against virus injuries and diseases. They have significant contributions in the development of the brain, cognition, homeostasis of the brain, and plasticity. Multiple studies have confirmed that uncontrolled microglial function can result in impaired microglial mitophagy, induced Aβ accumulation and tau pathology, and a chronic neuroinflammatory environment. In the brain, most of the genes that are associated with AD risk are highly expressed by microglia. Although it was initially regarded that microglia reaction is incidental and induced by dystrophic neurites and Aβ plaques. Nonetheless, it has been reported by genome-wide association studies that most of the risk loci for AD are located in genes that are occasionally uniquely and highly expressed in microglia. This finding further suggests that microglia play significant roles in early AD stages and they be targeted for the development of novel therapeutics. In this review, we have summarized the molecular pathogenesis of AD, microglial activities in the adult brain, the role of microglia in the aging brain, and the role of microglia in AD.

In mice aging exacerbates obesity-induced oxidative stress microvascular dysfunction blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and neuroinflammation which compromise cognitive health. However the specific mechanisms through which aging and obesity interact to remain elusive. Previously we have shown that Nrf2 signaling plays a critical role in microvascular resilience to obesity and that aging is associated with progressive Nrf2 dysfunction promoting microvascular impairment. To test the hypothesis that Nrf2 deficiency exacerbates cerebromicrovascular dysfunction induced by obesity Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- mice were fed an adipogenic high-fat diet (HFD). Nrf2 deficiency significantly exacerbated HFD-induced oxidative stress and cellular senescence impairment of neurovascular coupling responses BBB disruption and microglia activation mimicking the aging phenotype. Obesity in Nrf2-/- mice elicited complex alterations in the amyloidogenic gene expression profile including upregulation of amyloid precursor protein. Nrf2 deficiency and obesity additively reduced long-term potentiation in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Collectively Nrf2 dysfunction exacerbates the deleterious effects of obesity compromising cerebromicrovascular and brain health by impairing neurovascular coupling mechanisms BBB integrity and synaptic function and promoting neuroinflammation. These results support a possible role for age-related Nrf2 dysfunction in the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.,NA,"Reynolds Oklahoma Center on Aging Department of Geriatric Medicine University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Oklahoma City.Translational Geroscience Laboratory Department of Geriatric Medicine University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Oklahoma City.Department of Medical Physics and Informatics Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Science and Informatics University of Szeged Hungary.Department of Physiology University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Oklahoma City.Peggy & Charles Stephenson Oklahoma Cancer Center University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Oklahoma City.Translational Gerontology Branch National Institute on Aging Baltimore Maryland.Oklahoma Center for Neuroscience University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Oklahoma City.Department of Ophthalmology University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Oklahoma City.Dean McGee Eye Institute University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Oklahoma City.Aging and Metabolism Research Program Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation Oklahoma City.Harold Hamm Diabetes Center University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Oklahoma City.",2018,10.1093/gerona/glx177,,,,pubmed-29905772,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b,Laurel Renton,Included,Included

How this decline can be slowed or even reversed is a critical question. Here we discuss therapeutic ultrasound as a novel modality to achieve this goal. In our studies we explored three fundamental strategies (i) scanning ultrasound on its own (SUS(only)) (ii) therapeutic ultrasound in concert with intravenously injected microbubbles (which transiently opens the blood-brain barrier SUS(+MB)) and (iii) SUS(+MB) in combination with therapeutic antibodies (SUS(+MB+mAb)). These studies show SUS(+MB) effectively clears amyloid and restores memory in amyloid-depositing mice and partially clears Tau and ameliorates memory impairments in Tau transgenic mice with additional improvements found in combination trials (SUS(+MB+mAb)). Interestingly both SUS(only) and SUS(+MB) restored the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP electrophysiological correlate of memory) in senescent wild-type mice. Both lead to increased neurogenesis and SUS(only) in particular resulted in improved spatial memory. We discuss these findings side-by-side with our findings obtained in AD mouse models.

Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are promising candidates their clinical application is limited because of risks related to their direct implantation in the host. This could be overcome by exploiting their paracrine action. We herein demonstrate that in vivo systemic administration of secretome collected from MSC exposed in vitro to AD mouse brain homogenates (MSC-CS) fully replicates the cell-mediated neuroreparative effects in APP/PS1 AD mice. We found a complete but transient memory recovery by 7 days which vanished by 14 days after a single MSC-CS intravenous administration in 12-month or 22-24-month-old mice. Treatment significantly reduced plaque load microglia activation and expression of cytokines in astrocytes in younger but not aged mice at 7 days. To optimize efficacy we established a sustained treatment protocol in aged mice through intranasal route. Once-weekly intranasal administration of MSC-CS induced persistent memory recovery with dramatic reduction of plaques surrounded by a lower density of β-amyloid oligomers. Gliosis and the phagocytic marker CD68 were decreased. We found a higher neuronal density in cortex and hippocampus associated with a reduction in hippocampal shrinkage and a longer lifespan indicating healthier conditions of MSC-CS-treated compared to vehicle-treated APP/PS1 mice. Our data prove that MSC-CS displays a great multi-level therapeutic potential and lay the foundation for identifying the therapeutic secretome bioreactors leading to the development of an efficacious multi-reparative cocktail drug towards abrogating the need for MSC implantation and risks related to their direct use.,NA,"Department of Neuroscience Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS via Mario Negri 2 20156 Milan Italy.DINOGMI University of Genoa Largo Daneo 3 16132 Genoa Italy.School of Medicine and Surgery Nanomedicine Center NANOMIB University of Milano-Bicocca Via Raoul Follereau 3 20854 Vedano al Lambro MB Italy.Ospedale Policlinico San Martino IRCCS Largo Rosanna Benzi 10 16132 Genoa Italy.Department of Neuroscience Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS via Mario Negri 2 20156 Milan Italy. claudia.balducci@marionegri.it.",2021,10.1038/s41418-020-0592-2,,,,pubmed-32704089,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

Genetic deletion of Fndc5/irisin (global Fndc5 knock-out (KO) mice; F5KO) impairs cognitive function in exercise ageing and AD. Diminished pattern separation in F5KO mice can be rescued by delivering irisin directly into the dentate gyrus suggesting that irisin is the active moiety. In F5KO mice adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus are morphologically transcriptionally and functionally abnormal. Importantly elevation of circulating irisin levels by peripheral delivery of irisin via adeno-associated viral overexpression in the liver results in enrichment of central irisin and is sufficient to improve both the cognitive deficit and neuropathology in AD mouse models.

G.Zhang Y. J.Zhou L. P.Chen H.Yang N.Zhu Z. R ",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,Soluble amyloid beta (Aβ) is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increased soluble Aβ(1-42) in the hippocampus is closely correlated with spatial learning and memory deficits in AD. Riluzole (RLZ) an FDA-approved drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has beneficial effects for AD. However the mechanism underlying the effects remains unclear. In this study its neuroprotective effect against soluble Aβ(1-42)-induced spatial cognitive deficits in rats was assessed. We found that intrahippocampal injection of soluble Aβ(1-42) impaired spatial cognitive function and suppressed long-term potentiation (LTP) of the DG region which was relevant to soluble Aβ(1-42)-induced shift of the hippocampal excitation/inhibition balance toward excitation. Interestingly RLZ ameliorated Aβ(1-42)-induced behavioral and LTP impairments through rescuing the soluble Aβ(1-42)-induced excitation/inhibition imbalance. RLZ attenuated Aβ(1-42)-mediated facilitation of excitatory synaptic transmission by facilitating glutamate reuptake and decreasing presynaptic glutamate release. Meanwhile RLZ attenuated the suppression of inhibitory synaptic transmission caused by Aβ(1-42) by potentiating postsynaptic GABA receptor function. These results suggest that RLZ exerts a neuroprotective effect against soluble Aβ(1-42)-related spatial cognitive deficits through rescuing the excitation/inhibition imbalance and it could be a potential therapy for AD.,NA,"Department of Developmental Neuropsychology Army Medical University Chongqing 400038 China; Department of Urology The Second Affiliated Hospital Army Medical University Chongqing 400038 China.Department of Pharmacy Chongqing Medical and Pharmaceutical College Chongqing 401331 China.Department of Developmental Neuropsychology Army Medical University Chongqing 400038 China.Department of Physiology Army Medical University Chongqing 400038 China.Department of Developmental Neuropsychology Army Medical University Chongqing 400038 China.

However, it can form intraneuronal hyperphosphorylated aggregates that are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders known as tauopathies. Tau can be phosphorylated by multiple kinases at several sites. Among such kinases, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates tau at Ser214 (pTAU-S214), an event that was shown to reduce the pathological assembly of the protein. Given that the neuronal cAMP/PKA-activated cascade is involved in synaptic plasticity and memory, and that cAMP-enhancing strategies demonstrated promising therapeutic potential for the treatment of cognitive deficits, we investigated the impact of cAMP on pTAU-S214 in N2a cells and rat hippocampal slices. Our results confirm that the activation of adenylyl cyclase increases pTAU-S214 in both model systems and, more interestingly, this effect is mimicked by GEBR-7b, a phosphodiesterase 4D inhibitor with proven pro-cognitive efficacy in rodents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35561079,NA,2022,10.1002/biof.1847,,,,pubmed-35561079,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

S.Puzzo D.Arancio O ",J Alzheimers Dis,J Alzheimers Dis,"The ""Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis"" has dominated the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field in the last 25 years. It posits that the increase of amyloid-β (Aβ) is the key event in AD that triggers tau pathology followed by neuronal death and eventually the disease. However therapeutic approaches aimed at decreasing Aβ levels have so far failed and tau-based clinical trials have not yet produced positive findings. This begs the question of whether the hypothesis is correct. Here we have examined literature on the role of Aβ and tau in synaptic dysfunction memory loss and seeding and spreading of AD highlighting important parallelisms between the two proteins in all of these phenomena. We discuss novel findings showing binding of both Aβ and tau oligomers to amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) and the requirement for the presence of this protein for both Aβ and tau to enter neurons and induce abnormal synaptic function and memory. Most importantly we propose a novel view of AD pathogenesis in which extracellular oligomers of Aβ and tau act in parallel and upstream of AβPP. Such a view will call for a reconsideration of therapeutic approaches directed against Aβ and tau paving the way to an increased interest toward AβPP both for understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and elaborating new therapeutic strategies.",NA,"Department of Biomedical and Biotechnological Sciences Section of Physiology University of Catania Catania Italy.Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain Columbia University New York NY USA.Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Institute of Biotechnology and Biomedicine Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona Bellaterra Spain.Department of Anaesthesiology Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore Rome Italy.Department of Pharmacology Physiology and Neuroscience Rutgers University Newark NJ USA.Institute of Human Physiology Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore Rome Italy.Department of Psychiatry Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons New York NY USA.Department of Neurology Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons New York NY USA.Department of Pathology and Cell Biology Columbia University New York NY USA.",2018,10.3233/jad-179935,,,,pubmed-29865055,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

L.Selkoe D. J ",Acta Neuropathol Commun,Acta Neuropathol Commun,Pathologic biochemical and genetic evidence indicates that accumulation and aggregation of amyloid β-proteins (Aβ) is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several therapeutic interventions attempting to lower Aβ have failed to ameliorate cognitive decline in patients with clinical AD significantly but most such approaches target only one or two facets of Aβ production/clearance/toxicity and do not consider the heterogeneity of human Aβ species. As synaptic dysfunction may be among the earliest deficits in AD we used hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) as a sensitive indicator of the early neurotoxic effects of Aβ species. Here we confirmed prior findings that soluble Aβ oligomers much more than fibrillar amyloid plaque cores or Aβ monomers disrupt synaptic function. Interestingly not all (84%) human AD brain extracts are able to inhibit LTP and the degree of LTP impairment by AD brain extracts does not correlate with Aβ levels detected by standard ELISAs. Bioactive AD brain extracts also induce neurotoxicity in iPSC-derived human neurons. Shorter forms of Aβ (including Aβ(1-37) Aβ(1-38) Aβ(1-39)) pre-Aβ APP fragments (- 30 to - 1) and N-terminally extended Aβs (- 30 to + 40) each showed much less synaptotoxicity than longer Aβs (Aβ(1-42) - Aβ(1-46)). We found that antibodies which target the N-terminus not the C-terminus efficiently rescued Aβ oligomer-impaired LTP and oligomer-facilitated LTD. Our data suggest that preventing soluble Aβ oligomer formation and targeting their N-terminal residues with antibodies could be an attractive combined therapeutic approach.,NA,"Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases Department of Neurology Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School 60 Fenwood Road Boston MA 02115 USA. sli11@bwh.harvard.edu.Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases Department of Neurology Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School 60 Fenwood Road Boston MA 02115 USA.",2018,10.1186/s40478-018-0626-x,,,,pubmed-30409172,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Included,Included

Errico PSauer J. F.Erny D.Savanthrapadian S.Loreth D.Katzmarski N.Blank T.Bartos M.Prinz M.Meyer-Luehmann M ",Embo j,Embo j,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by severe neuronal loss as well as the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) which ultimately leads to plaque formation. Although there is now a general agreement that the aggregation of Abeta can be initiated by prion-like seeding the impact and functional consequences of induced Abeta deposits (Abeta seeding) on neurons still remain open questions. Here we find that Abeta seeding representing early stages of plaque formation leads to a dramatic decrease in proliferation and neurogenesis in two APP transgenic mouse models. We further demonstrate that neuronal cell death occurs primarily in the vicinity of induced Abeta deposits culminating in electrophysiological abnormalities. Notably environmental enrichment and voluntary exercise not only revives adult neurogenesis and reverses memory deficits but most importantly prevents Abeta seeding by activated phagocytic microglia cells. Our work expands the current knowledge regarding Abeta seeding and the consequences thereof and attributes microglia an important role in diminishing Abeta seeding by environmental enrichment.,NA,NA,2018,10.15252/embj.201797021,,,,pubmed-29229786,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Included,Included

Rapamycin is an activator of autophagy/mitophagy which plays an important role in identifying and degrading damaged mitochondria. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of rapamycin on cognitive and synaptic plasticity defects induced by AD and further explore if the underlying mechanism was associated with mitophagy. The results show that rapamycin increases Parkin-mediated mitophagy and promotes fusion of mitophagosome and lysosome in the APP/PS1 mouse hippocampus. Rapamycin enhances learning and memory viability synaptic plasticity and the expression of synapse-related proteins impedes cytochrome C-mediated apoptosis decreases oxidative status and recovers mitochondrial function in APP/PS1 mice. The data suggest that rapamycin effectively alleviates AD-like behaviors and synaptic plasticity deficits in APP/PS1 mice which is associated with enhanced mitophagy.

H.Liu P.Edgington-Mitchell L.Liu X.Wang X. C.Ye K ",Mol Psychiatry,Mol Psychiatry,Neurotrophins promote neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity via activating the tropomyosin receptor kinases. BDNF and its high-affinity receptor TrkB are reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) contributing to progressive cognitive decline. However how the signaling mediates AD pathologies remains incompletely understood. Here we show that the TrkB receptor binds and phosphorylates APP reducing amyloid-β production which are abrogated by δ-secretase cleavage of TrkB in AD. Remarkably BDNF stimulates TrkB to phosphorylate APP Y687 residue that accumulates APP in the TGN (Trans-Golgi Network) and diminishes its amyloidogenic cleavage. Delta-secretase cleaves TrkB at N365 and N486/489 residues and abolishes its neurotrophic activity decreasing p-APP Y687 and altering its subcellular trafficking. Notably both TrkB and APP are robustly cleaved by δ-secretase in AD brains accompanied by mitigated TrkB signaling and reduced p-Y687. Blockade of TrkB cleavage attenuates AD pathologies in 5xFAD mice rescuing the learning and memory. Viral expression of TrkB 1-486 fragment in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice facilitates amyloid pathology and mitigates cognitive functions. Hence δ-secretase cleaves TrkB and blunts its phosphorylation of APP facilitating AD pathogenesis.,NA,"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Emory University School of Medicine Atlanta GA 30322 USA.Department of Pathophysiology Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education of Neurological Diseases Tongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science and Technology Wuhan China.Neuroscience Program Laney Graduate School Emory University School of Medicine Atlanta GA USA.Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology School of Biomedical Sciences The University of Melbourne Melbourne VIC 3010 Australia.Department of Pathophysiology Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education of Neurological Diseases Tongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science and Technology Wuhan China. wxch@mails.tjmu.edu.cn.Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration Nantong University Nantong Jiangsu 226001 China. wxch@mails.tjmu.edu.cn.Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Emory University School of Medicine Atlanta GA 30322 USA. kye@emory.edu.",2021,10.1038/s41380-020-00863-8,,,,pubmed-32782380,01/23/2023 10:31:05,67b14272-623c-4f90-960c-3dd88bc9bc5f,Second pilot,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b,Laurel Renton,Excluded,Excluded
