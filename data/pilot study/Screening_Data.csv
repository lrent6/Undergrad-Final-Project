S.Lacas-Gervais S.Roques B. P.Chami M.Checler F ",Acta Neuropathol,Acta Neuropathol,One of the main components of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-affected brain is the Aβ peptide species harboring a pyroglutamate at position three pE3-Aβ. Several studies indicated that pE3-Aβ is toxic prone to aggregation and serves as a seed of Aβ aggregation. The cyclisation of the glutamate residue is produced by glutaminyl cyclase the pharmacological and genetic reductions of which significantly alleviate AD-related anatomical lesions and cognitive defects in mice models. The cyclisation of the glutamate in position 3 requires prior removal of the Aβ N-terminal aspartyl residue to allow subsequent biotransformation. The enzyme responsible for this rate-limiting catalytic step and its relevance as a putative trigger of AD pathology remained yet to be established. Here we identify aminopeptidase A as the main exopeptidase involved in the N-terminal truncation of Aβ and document its key contribution to AD-related anatomical and behavioral defects. First we show by mass spectrometry that human recombinant aminopeptidase A (APA) truncates synthetic Aβ1-40 to yield Aβ2-40. We demonstrate that the pharmacological blockade of APA with its selective inhibitor RB150 restores the density of mature spines and significantly reduced filopodia-like processes in hippocampal organotypic slices cultures virally transduced with the Swedish mutated Aβ-precursor protein (βAPP). Pharmacological reduction of APA activity and lowering of its expression by shRNA affect pE3-42Aβ- and Aβ1-42-positive plaques and expressions in 3xTg-AD mice brains. Further we show that both APA inhibitors and shRNA partly alleviate learning and memory deficits observed in 3xTg-AD mice. Importantly we demonstrate that concomitantly to the occurrence of pE3-42Aβ-positive plaques APA activity is augmented at early Braak stages in sporadic AD brains. Overall our data indicate that APA is a key enzyme involved in Aβ N-terminal truncation and suggest the potential benefit of targeting this proteolytic activity to interfere with AD pathology.,NA,"INSERM CNRS IPMC Team Labelled ""Laboratory of Excellence (LABEX) DistAlz"" Institut de Pharmacologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire Université Côte d'Azur 660 route des Lucioles Sophia-Antipolis 06560 Valbonne France.

In the light of increasing AD prevalence and lack of effective treatment, new strategies to prevent or reverse this condition are needed. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a newer antiepileptic drug that is commonly used to treat certain types of seizures. Researches indicated that LEV has several other pharmacological activities, including improvement of cognitive function. In this study, the recovery effects of chronic (28 days) administration of LEV (50, 100, and 150 mg/kg, ip) on cognitive deficits caused by the intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of streptozotocin (STZ), as a model for sporadic AD, were evaluated in rats. We also considered the protective effects of LEV against hippocampal cell loss, oxidative damage, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, neuroinflammation, and tauopathy caused by STZ. LEV (100 and 150 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the STZ-induced learning and memory impairments in the passive avoidance and Morris water maze (MWM) tasks. In addition, LEV suppressed STZ-induced hippocampal neuronal loss, while restored alterations in the redox status (lipid peroxides and glutathione), AChE activity, proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), and hyperphosphorylation of tau linked to STZ administration. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that LEV alleviated hippocampal cell death and memory deficits in STZ-AD rats, through mitigating oxidative damage, suppression of proinflammatory cytokines expression, and inhibition of abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35098412,NA,2022,10.1007/s11011-021-00888-0,,,,pubmed-35098412,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,False,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

S.Ruscher K.Sheppard O.Coleman M. P.Özen I ",Cell Death Dis,Cell Death Dis,Amyloid beta peptides (Aβ) proteins play a key role in vascular pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) including impairment of the blood-brain barrier and aberrant angiogenesis. Although previous work has demonstrated a pro-angiogenic role of Aβ the exact mechanisms by which amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and endothelial angiogenic signalling cascades interact in AD remain a largely unsolved problem. Here we report that increased endothelial sprouting in human-APP transgenic mouse (TgCRND8) tissue is dependent on β-secretase (BACE1) processing of APP. Higher levels of Aβ processing in TgCRND8 tissue coincides with decreased NOTCH3/JAG1 signalling overproduction of endothelial filopodia and increased numbers of vascular pericytes. Using a novel in vitro approach to study sprouting angiogenesis in TgCRND8 organotypic brain slice cultures (OBSCs) we find that BACE1 inhibition normalises excessive endothelial filopodia formation and restores NOTCH3 signalling. These data present the first evidence for the potential of BACE1 inhibition as an effective therapeutic target for aberrant angiogenesis in AD.,NA,"John van Geest Centre for Brain Repair Forvie Site Robinson Way Cambridge CB2 0PY UK.

M.Selkoe D. J.Li S ",Neurobiol Dis,Neurobiol Dis,As the most common cause of progressive cognitive decline in humans Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been intensively studied but the mechanisms underlying its profound synaptic dysfunction remain unclear. Here we confirm that exposing wild-type mice to an enriched environment (EE) facilitates signaling in the hippocampus that promotes long-term potentiation (LTP). Exposing the hippocampus of mice kept in standard housing to soluble Aβ oligomers impairs LTP but EE can fully prevent this. Mechanistically the key molecular features of the EE benefit are an upregulation of miRNA-132 and an inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) signaling. Specifically soluble Aβ oligomers decreased miR-132 expression and increased HDAC3 levels in cultured primary neurons. Further we provide evidence that HDAC3 is a direct target of miR-132. Overexpressing miR-132 or injecting an HDAC3 inhibitor into mice in standard housing mimics the benefits of EE in enhancing hippocampal LTP and preventing hippocampal impairment by Aβ oligomers in vivo. We conclude that EE enhances hippocampal synaptic plasticity by upregulating miRNA-132 and reducing HDAC3 signaling in a way that counteracts the synaptotoxicity of human Aβ oligomers. Our findings provide a rationale for prolonged exposure to cognitive novelty and/or epigenetic modulation to lessen the progressive effects of Aβ accumulation during human brain aging.,NA,"Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases Department of Neurology Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School Boston MA 02115 United States of America; Clinical and Translational Research Center Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital Tongji University School of Medicine Shanghai China.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) a group of chemically heterogenous medications are used widely in the treatment of inflammation. However the safety of these drugs is a growing concern due to their side effects on the gastrointestinal tract and liver. Royal jelly (RJ) is a potential functional food produced by the hypopharynx and mandibular salivary glands of nurse bees. In this study we explored the anti-neuroinflammatory effect of 10-hydroxydecanoic acid (10-HDAA) which is the second most abundant but less studied fatty acid in RJ. We showed that 10-HDAA decreased the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced elevation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) levels in both microglial BV-2 and N9 cell lines. Compared to the LPS group the 10-HDAA/LPS treated BV-2 cells had a higher level of the phagocytic receptor TREM2. RNAseq transcriptomic results showed a different transcriptional profile between the LPS group and the 10-HDAA/LPS group in BV-2 cells and the 10-HDAA pre-treatment significantly decreased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators which were further confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. Moreover we found that p53 was a target of 10-HDAA. p53 may mediate the anti-inflammation effect of 10-HDAA in two ways: first by directly deactivating the NLRP3 inflammatory pathway second by indirectly promoting autophagy. Taken together our results reveal a novel function of tumor suppressor p53 in the inhibition of neuroinflammation and provide a theoretical basis for broadening the application range of 10-HDAA and RJ.,NA,"College of Animal Sciences Zhejiang University Hangzhou 310058 China; Department of Animal Science McGill University 21 111 Lakeshore Road Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue H9X3V9 Quebec Canada.

G.Labrousse V.Grosjean N.Blanchet C.Frick A.Mulle C ",J Neurosci,J Neurosci,Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects the brain non-uniformly causing hippocampal memory deficits long before wide-spread brain degeneration becomes evident. Here we addressed whether mossy fiber inputs from the dentate gyrus onto CA3 principal cells are affected in an AD mouse model before amyloid β plaque deposition. We recorded from CA3 pyramidal cells in a slice preparation from 6-month-old male APP/PS1 mice and studied synaptic properties and intrinsic excitability. In parallel we performed a morphometric analysis of mossy fiber synapses following viral based labeling and 3D-reconstruction. We found that the basal structural and functional properties as well as presynaptic short-term plasticity at mossy fiber synapses are unaltered at 6 months in APP/PS1 mice. However transient potentiation of synaptic transmission mediated by activity-dependent release of lipids was abolished. Whereas the presynaptic form of mossy fiber long-term potentiation (LTP) was not affected the postsynaptic LTP of NMDAR-EPSCs was reduced. In addition we also report an impairment in feedforward inhibition in CA3 pyramidal cells. This study together with our previous work describing deficits at CA3-CA3 synapses provides evidence that early AD affects synapses in a projection-dependent manner at the level of a single neuronal population.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Because loss of episodic memory is considered the cognitive hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) it is important to study whether synaptic circuits involved in the encoding of episodic memory are compromised in AD mouse models. Here we probe alterations in the synaptic connections between the dentate gyrus and CA3 which are thought to be critical for enabling episodic memories to be formed and stored in CA3. We found that forms of synaptic plasticity specific to these synaptic connections are markedly impaired at an early stage in a mouse model of AD before deposition of β amyloid plaques. Together with previous work describing deficits at CA3-CA3 synapses we provide evidence that early AD affects synapses in an input-dependent manner within a single neuronal population.,NA,"University of Bordeaux Interdisciplinary Institute for Neuroscience CNRS UMR 5297 F-33000 Bordeaux France.

T.Song W.He G.Dong Z ",Signal Transduct Target Ther,Signal Transduct Target Ther,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) is an essential negative regulator of MAPKs by dephosphorylating MAPKs at both tyrosine and threonine residues. Dysregulation of the MAPK signaling pathway has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However the role of MKP-1 in AD pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we report that MKP-1 levels were decreased in the brain tissues of patients with AD and an AD mouse model. The reduction in MKP-1 gene expression appeared to be a result of transcriptional inhibition via transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) cis-acting binding elements in the MKP-1 gene promoter. Amyloid-β (Aβ)-induced Sp1 activation decreased MKP-1 expression. However upregulation of MKP-1 inhibited the expression of both Aβ precursor protein (APP) and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 by inactivating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK)/MAPK signaling pathway. Furthermore upregulation of MKP-1 reduced Aβ production and plaque formation and improved hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Our results demonstrate that MKP-1 impairment facilitates the pathogenesis of AD whereas upregulation of MKP-1 plays a neuroprotective role to reduce Alzheimer-related phenotypes. Thus this study suggests that MKP-1 is a novel molecule for AD treatment.,NA,"1Pediatric Research Institute Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders Chongqing Key Laboratory of Translational Medical Research in Cognitive Development and Learning and Memory Disorders Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University Chongqing 400014 PR China.

Coenzyme Q10 (Q10) is a powerful antioxidant that buffers the potential adverse consequences of free radicals. In this study we investigated the neuroprotective effects of Q10 on Aβ-induced impairment in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) a widely researched model of synaptic plasticity which occurs during learning and memory in a rat model of AD. In this study 50 adult male Wistar rats were assigned to five groups: control group (saline); sham group; intraventricular PBS injection Aβ group; intraventricular Aβ injection Q10 group; and Q10 via oral gavage and Q10 + Aβ group. Q10 was administered via oral gavage once a day for 3 weeks before and 3 weeks after the Aβ injection. After the treatment period in vivo electrophysiological recordings were performed to quantify the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) slope and population spike (PS) amplitude in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. LTP was created by a high-frequency stimulation of the perforant pathway. Following LTP induction the EPSP slope and PS amplitude were significantly diminished in Aβ-injected rats compared with sham and control rats. Q10 treatment of Aβ-injected rats significantly attenuated these decreases suggesting that Q10 reduces the effects of Aβ on LTP. Aβ significantly increased serum malondialdehyde levels and total oxidant levels whereas Q10 supplementation significantly reversed these parameters and increased total antioxidant capacity levels. The present findings suggested that Q10 treatment offers neuroprotection against the detrimental effects of Aβ on hippocampal synaptic plasticity via its antioxidant activity.,NA,"Neurophysiology Research Center Hamadan University of Medical Sciences Hamadan Iran.

Interest is growing in revealing and determining possible pathological markers also in the cerebellum as its involvement in cognitive functions is now well supported. Despite the central position of the Purkinje cell in the cerebellum, its electrophysiological behaviour in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease is scarce in the literature. Our first aim was here to focus on the electrophysiological behaviour of the cerebellum in awake mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) and the related performance on the water-maze test classically used in behavioural studies. We found prevalent signs of electrophysiological alterations in both Purkinje cells and deep cerebellar nuclei neurons which might explain the behavioural deficits reported during the water-maze test. The alterations of neurons firing were accompanied by a dual (~16 and ~228 Hz) local field potential's oscillation in the Purkinje cell layer of Alzheimer's disease mice which was concomitant to an important increase of both the simple and the complex spikes. In addition, β-amyloid deposits were present in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. These results highlight the importance of the output firing modification of the AD cerebellum that may indirectly impact the activity of its subcortical and cortical targets.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35141975,NA,2022,10.1111/ejn.15621,,,,pubmed-35141975,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,False,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

Abnormalities at any of these levels lead to decreased stress resilience and pathological behavior. However, temporal modulation of molecular pathways underlying stress response remains poorly understood. Transducer of ErbB2.1, known as TOB, is involved in different physiological functions, including cellular stress and immediate response to stimulation. In this study, we investigated the role of TOB in psychological stress machinery at molecular, neural circuit, and behavioral levels. Interestingly, TOB protein levels increased after mice were exposed to acute stress. At the neural circuit level, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suggested that intra-hippocampal and hippocampal-prefrontal connectivity were dysregulated in Tob knockout (Tob-KO) mice. Electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices showed increased postsynaptic AMPAR-mediated neurotransmission, accompanied by decreased GABA neurotransmission and subsequently altered Excitatory/Inhibitory balance after Tob deletion. At the behavioral level, Tob-KO mice show abnormal, hippocampus-dependent, contextual fear conditioning and extinction, and depression-like behaviors. On the other hand, increased anxiety observed in Tob-KO mice is hippocampus-independent. At the molecular level, we observed changes in factors involved in stress response like decreased stress-induced LCN2 expression and ERK phosphorylation, as well as increased MKP-1 expression. This study introduces TOB as an important modulator in the hippocampal stress signaling machinery. In summary, we reveal a molecular pathway and neural circuit mechanism by which Tob deletion contributes to expression of pathological stress-related behavior.",NA,Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences|Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University|Riken,2022,10.1038/s41398-022-02078-7,,,,scopus-2-s2.0-85135176351,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,False,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Included,Included

Its application to detect visual impairments during normal aging and over the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is evaluated in wild-type (WT) and transgenic APP(SWE)/PS1(∆E9) murine models of AD (AD(+)) across an array of irradiance chromaticity and contrast conditions. Substantial color and contrast-mode alternation deficits appear in AD(+) mice at an age when hippocampal-based memory and learning is still intact. Profiling of timespan entries and transition patterns between the different arms uncovers variable AD-associated impairments in contrast sensitivity and color discrimination reminiscent of tritanomalous defects documented in AD patients.

Z.Tian Q.Yu L. K.Zhou X. W ",J Alzheimers Dis,J Alzheimers Dis,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. It is reported that enzymatic degradation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plays a pivotal role in Aβ accumulation and type-2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R) participates in Aβ processing in the brain; however the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We determined that Aβ degradation-related proteins are significantly different between CB2R-/- mice and wild-type (WT) mice via proteomic analysis. Moreover the data demonstrated that the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) levels are substantially attenuated and the Aβ level is significantly enhanced in CB2R-/--Aβ1 - 42 mice compared with that of WT-Aβ1 - 42 mice. Furthermore Aβ-mediated synaptic dysfunction the loss of memory associated proteins and the suppression of glutamatergic transmission are more severe in CB2R-/--Aβ1 - 42 mice than that in WT-Aβ1 - 42 mice. CB2R activation could decrease Aβ1 - 40 and Aβ1 - 42 levels and enhance ACE and IDE levels with its selective agonist JWH133; however AM630 (CB2R antagonist) abrogates all changes induced by JWH133 in N2a cells with AβPP overexpression. Taken together our study demonstrated that the deletion of CB2R reduces exogenous Aβ degradation and aggravates the toxicity of Aβ via the reduction of ACE and IDE which suggests that CB2R is involved in the onset of AD and a potential therapeutic target for AD.,NA,"Department of Pathophysiology School of Basic Medicine Tongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science and Technology Wuhan China.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous noncoding small RNA molecules that regulate the expression and degradation of proteins. The present study induced symptoms of AD in mice via intraventricular injection of amyloidbeta 142 (Abeta142) which decreased levels of miR107. However miR107 levels increased following administration of miR107 mimic a doublestranded RNA molecule designed to imitate the native miRNA. Intraventricular injection of Abeta142 aggregates led to spatial memory impairments inhibited hippocampal longterm potentiation (LTP) and resulted in the loss of pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The miR107 mimic reversed the impairments of spatial memory and LTP and the loss of pyramidal neurons caused by Abeta neurotoxicity. Furthermore the miR107 mimic reversed the Abetainduced increase in Abeta142 and phosphorylated Tau levels. Critically Abeta142 injection decreased levels of brainderived neurotrophic factor and reduced the phosphorylation of tyrosine receptor kinase B and protein kinase B; these changes were reversed following treatment with the miR107 mimic.

M.Martinez M.Torres V. I.Wong G. W.Inestrosa N. C ",J Neurochem,J Neurochem,Dysregulated Wnt signaling is linked to major neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease (AD). In mouse models of AD activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway improves learning/memory but the mechanism for this remains unclear. The decline in brain function in AD patients correlates with reduced glucose utilization by neurons. Here we test whether improvements in glucose metabolism mediate the neuroprotective effects of Wnt in AD mouse model. APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice were used to model AD Andrographolide or Lithium was used to activate Wnt signaling and cytochalasin B was used to block glucose uptake. Cognitive function was assessed by novel object recognition and memory flexibility tests. Glucose uptake and the glycolytic rate were determined using radiotracer glucose. The activities of key enzymes of glycolysis such as hexokinase and phosphofructokinase Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)/Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) levels and the pentose phosphate pathway and activity of glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase were measured. Wnt activators significantly improved brain glucose utilization and cognitive performance in transgenic mice. Wnt signaling enhanced glucose metabolism by increasing the expression and/or activity of hexokinase phosphofructokinase and AMP-activated protein kinase. Inhibiting glucose uptake partially abolished the beneficial effects of Wnt signaling on learning/memory. Wnt activation also enhanced glucose metabolism in cortical and hippocampal neurons as well as brain slices derived from APPswe/PS1E9 transgenic mice. Combined these data provide evidence that the neuroprotective effects of Wnt signaling in AD mouse models result at least in part from Wnt-mediated improvements in neuronal glucose metabolism.,NA,"Departamento de Biología Celular y Molecular Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas Centro de Envejecimiento y Regeneración (CARE-UC) Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile Santiago Chile.

C ",Front Aging Neurosci,Front Aging Neurosci,The role of the cerebellum in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been neglected for a long time. Recent studies carried out using transgenic mouse models have demonstrated that amyloid-β (Aβ) is deposited in the cerebellum and affects synaptic transmission and plasticity sometimes before plaque formation. A wide variability of motor phenotype has been observed in the different murine models of AD without a consistent correlation with the extent of cerebellar histopathological changes or with cognitive deficits. The loss of noradrenergic drive may contribute to the impairment of cerebellar synaptic function and motor learning observed in these mice. Furthermore cerebellar neurons particularly granule cells have been used as in vitro model of Aβ-induced neuronal damage. An unexpected conclusion is that the cerebellum for a long time thought to be somehow protected from AD pathology is actually considered as a region vulnerable to Aβ toxic damage even at the early stage of the disease with consequences on motor performance.,NA,"Neuroscience Institute Cavalieri Ottolenghi (NICO) Turin Italy.

Oxidative stress and amyloid β peptides (Aβ) accumulation have been recognized as therapeutic targets for AD. Herein with ability to inhibit Aβ aggregation and the broad-spectrum antioxidant properties the large amino acid mimicking selenium-doped carbon quantum dots (SeCQDs) are presented as novel nanoagents for multi-target therapy of AD. Compared with the precursor selenocystine SeCQDs which maintain the intrinsic properties of both selenium and carbon quantum dots (CQDs) possess good biocompatibility and a remarkable ROS-scavenging activity. Moreover the functionalized α-carboxyl and amino groups on edge of SeCQDs can trigger multivalent interactions with Aβ leading to the ability of SeCQDs to inhibit Aβ aggregation. In vivo study demonstrated that SeCQDs can significantly ameliorate the Aβ induced memory deficits reduce Aβ accumulation and inhibit neuron degeneration in AD model rats. The versatility of functionalization and potential ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) make SeCQDs as prospective nanodrugs for treating AD.,NA,College of Pharmacy Key Laboratory of Innovative Drug Development and Evaluation Hebei Medical University Shijiazhuang China.,2021,10.3389/fphar.2021.778613,,,,pubmed-34776988,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,False,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b,Laurel Renton,Excluded,Excluded

M.Song H.Zheng G.Shen X. F ",Front Cell Dev Biol,Front Cell Dev Biol,Lead (Pb) can cause a significant neurotoxicity in both adults and children leading to the impairment to brain function. Pb exposure plays a key role in the impairment of learning and memory through synaptic neurotoxicity resulting in the cognitive function. Researches have demonstrated that Pb exposure plays an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. However the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the current study a gestational Pb exposure (GLE) rat model was established to investigate the underlying mechanisms of Pb-induced cognitive impairment. We demonstrated that low-level gestational Pb exposure impaired spatial learning and memory as well as hippocampal synaptic plasticity at postnatal day 30 (PND 30) when the blood concentration of Pb had already recovered to normal levels. Pb exposure induced a decrease in hippocampal glucose metabolism by reducing glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) levels in the cell membrane through the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-Akt) pathway. In vivo and in vitro GLUT4 over-expression increased the membrane translocation of GLUT4 and glucose uptake and reversed the Pb-induced impairment to synaptic plasticity and cognition. These findings indicate that Pb exposure impairs synaptic plasticity by reducing the level of GLUT4 in the cell membrane as well as glucose uptake via the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway demonstrating a novel mechanism for Pb exposure-induced neurotoxicity.,NA,"Department of Occupational and Environmental Health and the Ministry of Education Key Lab of Hazard Assessment and Control in Special Operational Environment School of Public Health Fourth Military Medical University Xi'an China.

L.Li B. X.Yin L. Y.Xu B ",Neurochem Res,Neurochem Res,Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) which may be related to mitophagy failure. Previous reports suggest that treadmill exercise protects against mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. However few studies have investigated the relationship between mitophagy and mitochondrial adaptation caused by treadmill exercise in AD. The current study aimed to investigate whether exercise-ameliorated AD is associated with changes in mitophagy activity. Both Wild-type and APP/PS1 transgenic mice were divided into sedentary (WTC and ADC) and exercise (WTE and ADE) groups (n = 9 for each group). WTE and ADE mice were subjected to treadmill exercise for 12 weeks followed by evaluating the effect of treadmill exercise on learning and memory ability Aβ plaques mitochondrial Aβ peptide level synaptic activity and mitochondrial function. Meanwhile mitophagy-related proteins PINK1 Parkin LC3II and P62 were measured in the hippocampal mitochondrial fractions. The results indicated that exercise not only restored learning and memory ability but also reduced Aβ plaque area mitochondrial Aβ peptide level and increased levels of synaptic markers SYN and GAP43 as well as reversed mitochondrial dysfunction (defective mitochondrial ultrastructure decreased PGC-1α TFAM and ATP levels) in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Moreover exercise increased mitophagy activity as evidenced by a significant decrease in levels of P62 and PINK1 as well as an increase in levels of LC3II and Parkin in ADE mice. These findings suggest that treadmill exercise can enhance mitophagy activity in the hippocampus which is efficient in ameliorating pathological phenotypes of APP/PS1 transgenic mice.,NA,"Key Laboratory of Adolescent Health Assessment and Exercise Intervention of Ministry of Education East China Normal University 500 Dongchuan Road Shanghai 200241 China.

Ellagic acid (EA) is a phenolic phytoconstituent obtained from grains and fruits having evident antioxidant effects and known to modulate several endogenous molecular signals in humans in a beneficial way. The current study evaluated the safety profile of EA in the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line performing anti-oxidative effect by DPPH assay and evaluating anti-AchE (acetylcholinesterase) effect against AchE enzyme from Electrophorus electricus. The observations were further confirmed by in vivo therapeutic effects in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced SAD rats in the context of altered biochemical and behavioral features. Treatment with EA (50 mg/kg p.o.) for 30 days revealed reduction in STZ (3 mg/kg i.c.v.) prompted SAD and associated biochemical abnormalities in experimental rats which included diminished oxidative stress profile pro-inflammatory markers i.e. GFAP and CRP; AchE level and amyloid-β plaque level. Moreover an elevated level of synaptophysin indicated improved synaptic connectivity and intact neural architecture showed neuroprotection in the EA group. Furthermore the behavioral investigation by maze paradigms revealed reduced locomotor behavior irregular spontaneous alternation declination in memory score and increased memory errors in SAD rats. EA treatment normalized these SAD-associated abnormal behavioral representations in rats. Hence our findings suggest neuroprotective effects of EA and improvement in cognitive behavior in SAD rats.,NA,"Department of Pharmacology Institute of Pharmacy Nirma University Ahmedabad 382481 Gujarat India.

R.Williams S. C. R.Killick R.Cash D ",Sci Rep,Sci Rep,Amyloid plaques are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that develop in its earliest stages. Thus non-invasive detection of these plaques would be invaluable for diagnosis and the development and monitoring of treatments but this remains a challenge due to their small size. Here we investigated the utility of manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) for visualizing plaques in transgenic rodent models of AD across two species: 5xFAD mice and TgF344-AD rats. Animals were given subcutaneous injections of MnCl(2) and imaged in vivo using a 9.4 T Bruker scanner. MnCl(2) improved signal-to-noise ratio but was not necessary to detect plaques in high-resolution images. Plaques were visible in all transgenic animals and no wild-types and quantitative susceptibility mapping showed that they were more paramagnetic than the surrounding tissue. This combined with beta-amyloid and iron staining indicate that plaque MR visibility in both animal models was driven by plaque size and iron load. Longitudinal relaxation rate mapping revealed increased manganese uptake in brain regions of high plaque burden in transgenic animals compared to their wild-type littermates. This was limited to the rhinencephalon in the TgF344-AD rats while it was most significantly increased in the cortex of the 5xFAD mice. Alizarin Red staining suggests that manganese bound to plaques in 5xFAD mice but not in TgF344-AD rats. Multi-parametric MEMRI is a simple viable method for detecting amyloid plaques in rodent models of AD. Manganese-induced signal enhancement can enable higher-resolution imaging which is key to visualizing these small amyloid deposits. We also present the first in vivo evidence of manganese as a potential targeted contrast agent for imaging plaques in the 5xFAD model of AD.,NA,"BRAIN Centre (Biomarker Research and Imaging for Neuroscience) Department of Neuroimaging King's College London The James Black Centre 125 Coldharbour Lane London SE5 9NU UK. eugene.kim@kcl.ac.uk.

However the related molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Microglial toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) are two key regulators of inflammation that may play an essential role in this complex pathophysiological process. In this study intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into APP/PS1 transgenic AD model was used to mimic systemic inflammation in the development of AD. Initial results from the cortex showed that compared with wild-type mice APP/PS1 mice exhibited elevated gene and protein expression levels of both TLR4 and TREM2 with different degree. Interestingly after LPS treatment TLR4 expression was persistently up-regulated while TREM2 expression was significantly down-regulated in APP/PS1 mice suggesting that the negative regulatory effect of TREM2 on inflammation might be suppressed by LPS-induced hyperactive TLR4. This imbalance of TLR4/TREM2 contributed to microglial over-activation followed by increased neuronal apoptosis in the cortex of APP/PS1 mice; these changes did not alter the expression level of Aβ(1-42). Similar alterations were observed in our in vitro experiment with β-amyloid(1-42) (Aβ(1-42))-treated N9 microglia. Further Morris water maze (MWM) testing data indicated that LPS administration acutely aggravated cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice suggesting that the addition of systemic inflammation can potentially accelerate the progression of AD. Collectively we conclude that an imbalance of TLR4/TREM2 may be a potential link between AD and systemic inflammation. TREM2 can serve as a potential therapeutic target for treating systemic inflammation in AD progression.,NA,"Department of Geriatrics The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University 1 Youyi Road Yuzhong District Chongqing 400016 China.

C ",Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and neurodegenerative disorder of the cortex and hippocampus which eventually leads to cognitive impairment. Although the etiology of AD remains unclear the presence of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides in these learning and memory regions is a hallmark of AD. Therefore the inhibition of Aβ peptide aggregation has been considered the primary therapeutic strategy for AD treatment. Many studies have shown that resveratrol has antioxidant anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties and can decrease the toxicity and aggregation of Aβ peptides in the hippocampus of AD patients promote neurogenesis and prevent hippocampal damage. In addition the antioxidant activity of resveratrol plays an important role in neuronal differentiation through the activation of silent information regulator-1 (SIRT1). SIRT1 plays a vital role in the growth and differentiation of neurons and prevents the apoptotic death of these neurons by deacetylating and repressing p53 activity; however the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Resveratrol also has anti-inflammatory effects as it suppresses M1 microglia activation which is involved in the initiation of neurodegeneration and promotes Th2 responses by increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines and SIRT1 expression. This review will focus on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory neuroprotective effects of resveratrol specifically on its role in SIRT1 and the association with AD pathophysiology.,NA,"Neuroscience and Cell Biology Graduate Program Institute of Biological Sciences Federal University of Pará Belém Pará Brazil.

In the synaptic context the actin cytoskeleton is a crucial element to maintain the dendritic spine architecture and to orchestrate the spine's morphology remodeling driven by synaptic activity. Indeed spine shape and synaptic strength are strictly correlated and precisely governed during plasticity phenomena in order to convert short-term alterations of synaptic strength into long-lasting changes that are embedded in stable structural modification. These functional and structural modifications are considered the biological basis of learning and memory processes. In this review we discussed the existing evidence regarding the role of the spine actin cytoskeleton in AD synaptic failure. We revised the physiological function of the actin cytoskeleton in the spine shaping and the contribution of actin dynamics in the endocytosis mechanism. The internalization process is implicated in different aspects of AD since it controls both glutamate receptor membrane levels and amyloid generation.

Field recordings in the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) hippocampus showed that neonatal control 3xTg mice exhibited hypo-excitable synaptic transmission reduced paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and normal long-term potentiation (LTP) compared to NonTg controls. By contrast the old control 3xTg mice exhibited hyper-excitable synaptic transmission enhanced PPF and unstable LTP compared to NonTg controls. Repeated Iso exposures reduced synaptic transmission and PPF in neonatal NonTg and old 3xTg mice. LTP was normalized in old 3xTg mice but reduced in neonates. By contrast LTP was reduced in old but not neonatal NonTg mice. Our results indicate that Iso-mediated neuropathologic and cognitive defects in AD mice are associated with synaptic pathologies in an age-dependent manner. Based on these findings the extent of this association with age and possibly treatment paradigms warrant further study.,NA,"Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Perelman School of Medicine University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia PA United States of America.

C.Chen M. F.Wen Z. H.Huang H. T.Liu I. Y ",Mar Drugs,Mar Drugs,Memory retrieval dysfunction is a symptom of schizophrenia autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and absence epilepsy (AE) as well as an early sign of Alzheimer's disease. To date few drugs have been reported to enhance memory retrieval. Here we found that a coral-derived natural product excavatolide-B (Exc-B) enhances contextual memory retrieval in both wild-type and Ca(v)3.2(-/-) mice via repressing the delayed rectifier potassium current thus lowering the threshold for action potential initiation and enhancing induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). The human CACNA1H gene encodes a T-type calcium channel (Ca(v)3.2) and its mutation is associated with schizophrenia ASD and AE which are all characterized by abnormal memory function. Our previous publication demonstrated that Ca(v)3.2(-/-) mice exhibit impaired contextual-associated memory retrieval whilst their retrieval of spatial memory and auditory cued memory remain intact. The effect of Exc-B on enhancing the retrieval of context-associated memory provides a hope for novel drug development.,NA,"Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics Tzu Chi University Hualien 970 Taiwan. yuchunirene@gate.sinica.edu.tw.

However the specific role of reactive astrocytes is still debated. This controversy may stem from the fact that most strategies used to modulate astrocyte reactivity and explore its contribution to disease outcomes have only limited specificity. Moreover reactive astrocytes are now emerging as heterogeneous cells and all types of astrocyte reactivity may not be controlled efficiently by such strategies.Here we used cell type-specific approaches in vivo and identified the JAK2-STAT3 pathway as necessary and sufficient for the induction and maintenance of astrocyte reactivity. Modulation of this cascade by viral gene transfer in mouse astrocytes efficiently controlled several morphological and molecular features of reactivity. Inhibition of this pathway in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease improved three key pathological hallmarks by reducing amyloid deposition improving spatial learning and restoring synaptic deficits.In conclusion the JAK2-STAT3 cascade operates as a master regulator of astrocyte reactivity in vivo. Its inhibition offers new therapeutic opportunities for Alzheimer's disease.,NA,"Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives Département de la Recherche Fondamentale Institut de Biologie François Jacob MIRCen 92260 Fontenay-aux-Roses France.

P.Manfredsson F. P.Sandoval I. M.Johnson P. F.Jia J.Wang J. Z.Ye K ",Nat Commun,Nat Commun,Delta-secretase cleaves both APP and Tau to mediate the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However how aging contributes to an increase in delta-secretase expression and AD pathologies remains unclear. Here we show that a CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ) an inflammation-regulated transcription factor acts as a key age-dependent effector elevating both delta-secretase (AEP) and inflammatory cytokines expression in mediating pathogenesis in AD mouse models. We find that C/EBPβ regulates delta-secretase transcription and protein levels in an age-dependent manner. Overexpression of C/EBPβ in young 3xTg mice increases delta-secretase and accelerates the pathological features including cognitive dysfunctions which is abolished by inactive AEP C189S. Conversely depletion of C/EBPβ from old 3xTg or 5XFAD mice diminishes delta-secretase and reduces AD pathologies leading to amelioration of cognitive impairment in these AD mouse models. Thus our findings support that C/EBPβ plays a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis via increasing delta-secretase expression.,NA,"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Emory University School of Medicine Atlanta GA 30322 USA.

K.Herrmann A. G.Jain P.Stevenson A. J.Oren I.Hardt O.Spires-Jones T. L ",Eur J Neurosci,Eur J Neurosci,One of the key knowledge gaps in the field of Alzheimer's disease research is the lack of understanding of how amyloid beta and tau cooperate to cause neurodegeneration. We recently generated a mouse model (APP/PS1 + Tau) that develops amyloid plaque pathology and expresses human tau in the absence of endogenous murine tau. These mice exhibit an age-related behavioural hyperactivity phenotype and transcriptional deficits which are ameliorated by tau transgene suppression. We hypothesized that these mice would also display memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits as has been reported for many plaque bearing mouse models which express endogenous mouse tau. We observed that our APP/PS1 + Tau model does not exhibit novel object memory or robust long-term potentiation deficits with age whereas the parent APP/PS1 line with mouse tau did develop the expected deficits. These data are important as they highlight potential functional differences between mouse and human tau and the need to use multiple models to fully understand Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic strategies.,NA,"Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences and UK Dementia Research Institute The University of Edinburgh Edinburgh UK.

Y.Liu P.Jin G.Xu Q.Jiao Q.Wang L. H.Zou L. B ",European Journal of Pharmacology,European Journal of Pharmacology,Xanthoceraside a novel triterpenoid saponin extracted from the husks of Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge has neuroprotective effects in vivo and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro. However the exact mechanism of xanthoceraside on anti-amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced neuroinflammatory responses has not been elucidated. Therefore we used intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid <inf>1-42</inf> (Abeta<inf>1-42</inf>) to establish a mouse model to test the effects of xanthoceraside on Abeta-induced cognitive impairments and the TLR2/NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways. The mice received xanthoceraside (0.02 0.08 or 0.32 mg/kg) or vehicle from the day of Abeta<inf>1-42</inf> injection. The Morris water maze test was performed 4 days after Abeta<inf>1-42</inf> injection. The levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-4) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b) in the hippocampus were determined with an immunohistochemistry assay. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were analysed by Western blotting; iNOS COX-2 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) mRNA expression levels were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Here we observed that xanthoceraside at doses of 0.08 and 0.32 mg/kg significantly improved learning and memory impairments and significantly inhibited GFAP and CD11b overexpression induced by Abeta<inf>1-42</inf> in mice. ELISA results revealed that xanthoceraside suppressed IL-6 release and increased IL-4 levels. Western blotting results showed that xanthoceraside reduced iNOS and COX-2 protein levels in hippocampus; xanthoceraside also inhibited translocation of NF-kappaB p50 and p65 into the nucleus and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. RT-PCR confirmed that xanthoceraside decreased iNOS COX-2 and TLR2 mRNA levels. These results suggest that xanthoceraside inhibition of the TLR2 pathway and down-regulation of MAPK and NF-kappaB activities may be related to the improvement in learning and memory impairments.

C.de Almeida G. R. L.Cunha M. P.Dafre A. L ",Neurochem Res,Neurochem Res,Methylglyoxal (MGO) is a highly reactive dicarbonyl molecule that promotes the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) which are believed to play a key role in a number of pathologies such as diabetes Alzheimer's disease and inflammation. Here Swiss mice were treated with MGO by intraperitoneal injection to investigate its effects on motor activity mood and cognition. Acute MGO treatment heavily decreased locomotor activity in the open field test at higher doses (80-200 mg/kg) an effect not observed at lower doses (10-50 mg/kg). Several alterations were observed 4 h after a single MGO injection (10-50 mg/kg): (a) plasma MGO levels were increased (b) memory was impaired (object location task) (c) anxiolytic behavior was observed in the open field and marble burying test and (d) depressive-like behavior was evidenced as evaluated by the tail suspension test. Biochemical alterations in the glutathione and glyoxalase systems were not observed 4 h after MGO treatment. Mice were also treated daily with MGO at 0 10 25 and 50 mg/kg for 11 days. From the 5th to the 11th day several behavioral end points were evaluated resulting in: (a) absence of motor impairment as evaluated in the open field horizontal bars and pole test (b) depressive-like behavior observed in the tail suspension test and (c) cognitive impairments detected on working short- and long-term memory when mice were tested in the Y-maze spontaneous alternation object location and recognition tests and step-down inhibitory avoidance task. An interesting finding was a marked decrease in dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex of mice treated with 50 mg/kg MGO for 11 days along with a ~ 25% decrease in the Glo1 content. The MGO-induced dopamine depletion in the prefrontal cortex may be related to the observed memory deficits and depressive-like behavior an interesting topic to be further studied as a potentially novel route for MGO toxicity.,NA,"Neurosciences Post-Graduation Program Federal University of Santa Catarina Florianópolis SC 88040-900 Brazil.

B.Xie X. Y.Chen S. W.Huang Q.Huang W. Y.Zhang R.Chen H. Z.Wang H.Wang G ",Aging Cell,Aging Cell,Different cellular and molecular changes underlie the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among these neuron-specific dysregulation is a necessary event for accumulation of classic pathologies including amyloid plaques. Here we show that AD-associated pathophysiology including neuronal cell death inflammatory signaling and endolysosomal dysfunction is spatially colocalized to amyloid plaques in regions with abnormal microRNA-425 (miR-425) levels and this change leads to focal brain microenvironment heterogeneity that is an amyloid plaque-associated microenvironment (APAM). APAM consists of multiple specific neurodegenerative signature pathologies associated with senile plaques that contribute to the heterogeneity and complexity of AD. Remarkably miR-425 a neuronal-specific regulator decreased in AD brain maintains a normal spatial transcriptome within brain neurons. We tested the hypothesis that miR-425 loss correlates with enhanced levels of mRNA targets downstream supporting APAM and AD progression. A miR-425-deficient mouse model has enhanced APP amyloidogenic processing neuroinflammation neuron loss and cognitive impairment. In the APP/PS1 mouse model intervening with miR-425 supplementation ameliorated APAM changes and memory deficits. This study reveals a novel mechanism of dysregulation of spatial transcriptomic changes in AD brain identifying a probable neuronal-specific microRNA regulator capable of staving off amyloid pathogenesis. Moreover our findings provide new insights for developing AD treatment strategies with miRNA oligonucleotide(s).,NA,"Department of Neurology and Neuroscience Institute Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine Shanghai China.

Y.Zhang C. H.Yang J. J.Xu P. P.Yi P. J.Hu M. L.Peng W. J ",J Integr Med,J Integr Med,OBJECTIVE: Bushen Tiansui formula (BSTSF) a traditional Chinese medicine prescription has been widely used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). However the mechanisms underlying its effects remain largely unknown. In this study a rat AD model was used to study the effects of BSTSF on cognitive performance and expression of transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) in the hippocampus to determine whether treatment of AD with BSTSF could regulate the expression of tsRNAs a novel small non-coding RNA. METHODS: To generate a validated AD model oligomeric amyloid-β(1-42) (Aβ(1-42)) was injected intracerebroventricularly into rats. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was used to evaluate rat cognitive performance and tsRNA-sequencing was conducted to examine tsRNA expression in the rat hippocampus. Potential targets were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Bioinformatic analyses were conducted to investigate the biological function of candidate tsRNAs. RESULTS: The learning and memory deficits of Aβ(1-42)-induced AD rats assessed by MWM tests were clearly ameliorated by BSTSF treatment. A total of 387 tsRNAs were detected in the rat hippocampus. Among them 13 were significantly dysregulated in AD rats compared with sham control rats while 57 were markedly altered by BSTSF treatment relative to untreated AD rats (fold change ≥ 2 and P < 0.05). Moreover six BSTSF treatment-related tsRNAs were identified and validated by qRT-PCR. Bioinformatic analyses indicated that the six treatment-related tsRNAs had potential therapeutic roles via multiple signaling pathways and Gene Ontology biological functions including cyclic adenosine monophosphate and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling. CONCLUSION: This study identified a previously uncharacterized mechanism underlying the effects of BSTSF in alleviating the learning and memory deficits in Aβ(1-42)-induced AD rats demonstrating that tsRNAs are potential therapeutic targets of BSTSF in the treatment of AD.,NA,"Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese & Western Medicine the Second Xiangya Hospital Central South University Changsha 410011 Hunan Province China.

H ",Heliyon,Heliyon,Decades of research attempting to slow the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) indicates that a better understanding of memory will be key to the discovery of effective therapeutic approaches. Here we ask whether prodromal neural network dysfunction might occur in the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit by using α5IA (an established memory enhancer and selective negative allosteric modulator of extrasynaptic tonically active α5GABA-A receptors) as a probe drug in TgF344-AD transgenic rats a model for β-amyloid induced early onset AD. The results demonstrate that orally bioavailable α5IA increases CA1 pyramidal cell mean firing rates during foraging and peak ripple amplitude during wakeful immobility in wild type F344 rats in a familiar environment. We further demonstrate that CA1 ripples in TgF344-AD rats are nonresponsive to α5IA by 9 months of age prior to the onset of AD-like pathology and memory dysfunction. TgF344-AD rats express human β-amyloid precursor protein (with the Swedish mutation) and human presenilin-1 (with a Δ exon 9 mutation) and we found high serum Aβ42 and Aβ40 levels by 3 months of age. When taken together this demonstrates to the best of our knowledge the first evidence for prodromal α5GABA-A receptor dysfunction in the ripple-generating hippocampal trisynaptic circuit of AD-like transgenic rats. As α5GABA-A receptors are found at extrasynaptic and synaptic contacts we posit that negative modulation of α5GABA-A receptor mediated tonic as well as phasic inhibition augments CA1 ripples and memory consolidation but that this modulatory mechanism is lost at an early stage of AD onset.,NA,"Department of Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics Boston University School of Medicine Boston Massachusetts USA.

Multiple mechanisms may account for their effects and different brain regions may variably respond. Here we considered how a KD affects brain neuron and astrocyte transcription. We placed male C57Bl6/N mice on either a 3-month KD or chow diet generated enriched neuron and astrocyte fractions and used RNA-Seq to assess transcription. Neurons from KD-treated mice generally showed transcriptional pathway activation while their astrocytes showed a mix of transcriptional pathway suppression and activation. The KD especially affected pathways implicated in mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum function insulin signaling and inflammation. An unbiased analysis of KD-associated expression changes strongly implicated transcriptional pathways altered in AD which prompted us to explore in more detail the potential molecular relevance of a KD to AD. Our results indicate a KD differently affects neurons and astrocytes and provide unbiased evidence that KD-induced brain effects are potentially relevant to neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.,NA,"University of Kansas Alzheimer's Disease Center Kansas City KS USA.

Z.Tseng G. F ",Brain Struct Funct,Brain Struct Funct,Rostral intralaminar thalamic deep brain stimulation (ILN-DBS) has been shown to enhance attention and cognition through neuronal activation and brain plasticity. We examined whether rostral ILN-DBS can also attenuate memory deficits and impaired synaptic plasticity and protect glutamatergic transmission in the rat intraventricular β-amyloid (Aβ) infusion model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Spatial memory was tested in the Morris water maze (MWM) while structural synaptic plasticity and glutamatergic transmission strength were estimated by measuring dendritic spine densities in dye-injected neurons and tissue expression levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus. All these assessments were compared among the naïve control rats AD rats and AD rats with ILN-DBS. We found that a single rostral ILN-DBS treatment significantly improved MWM performance and reversed PSD-95 expression reductions in the mPFC and hippocampal region of Aβ-infused rats. In addition ILN-DBS preserved dendritic spine densities on mPFC and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. In fact MWM performance PSD-95 expression levels and dendritic spine densities did not differ between naïve control and rostral ILN-DBS treatment groups indicating near complete amelioration of Aβ-induced spatial memory impairments and dendritic regression. These findings suggest that the ILN is critical for modulating glutamatergic transmission neural plasticity and spatial memory functions through widespread effects on distributed brain regions. Further these findings provide a rationale for examining the therapeutic efficacy of ILN-DBS in AD patients.,NA,"Department of Neurosurgery Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation/Tzu Chi University Hualien Taiwan.

N.Long Y.Suppiramaniam V.Tang S.Hong H ",Aging (Albany NY),Aging (Albany NY),As a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid-β (Aβ) is regarded as a causative factor for cognitive impairment. Extensive studies have found Aβ induces a series of pathophysiological responses finally leading to memory loss in AD. Our previous results demonstrated that cysteinyl leukotrienes receptor 1 (CysLT(1)R) antagonists improved exogenous Aβ-induced memory impairment. But the role of CysLT(1)R in AD and its underlying mechanisms still remain elusive. In this study we investigated CysLT(1)R levels in AD patients and APP/PS1 mice. We also generated APP/PS1-CysLT(1)R(-/-) mice by clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated CysLT(1)R deletion in APP/PS1 mice and studied the effect of CysLT(1)R knockout on amyloidogenesis synapse structure and plasticity cognition neuroinflammation and kynurenine pathway. These attributes were also studied after lentivirus-mediated knockdown of CysLT(1)R gene in APP/PS1 mice. We found that CysLT(1)R knockout or knockdown could conserve synaptic structure and plasticity and improve cognition in APP/PS1 mice. These effects were associated with concurrent decreases in amyloid processing reduced neuroinflammation and suppression of the kynurenine pathway. Our study demonstrates that CysLT(1)R deficiency can mediate several beneficial effects against AD pathogenesis and genetic/pharmacological ablation of this protein could be a potential therapeutic option for AD.,NA,"Department of Pharmacology China Pharmaceutical University Nanjing China.

This review examines the latest evidence of a novel and newly introduced perspective which focuses on the restoration of gamma oscillations and investigates their potential role in the treatment of AD. Gamma brain activity (∼25-100 Hz) has been well-known for its role in cognitive function including memory and it is fundamental for healthy brain activity and intra-brain communication. Aberrant gamma oscillations have been observed in both mice AD models and human AD patients. A recent line of work demonstrated that gamma entrainment through auditory and visual sensory stimulation can effectively attenuate AD pathology and improve cognitive function in mice models of the disease. The first evidence from AD patients indicate that gamma entrainment therapy can reduce loss of functional connectivity and brain atrophy improve cognitive function and ameliorate several pathological markers of the disease. Even though research is still in its infancy evidence suggests that gamma-based therapy may have a disease-modifying effect and has signified a new and promising era in AD research.,NA,Department of Rehabilitation Sciences Faculty of Health Sciences Cyprus University of Technology Limassol Cyprus.,2021,10.3389/fnsys.2021.782399,,,,pubmed-34966263,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,False,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

Recent evidence indicates that amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) is trafficked to synapses and promotes their formation. At the synapse AβPP interacts with synaptic proteins involved in vesicle exocytosis and affects calcium channel function. OBJECTIVE: Herein we examined the role of AβPP in depolarization-induced calcium-mediated signaling using acute cerebral slices from wild-type C57bl/6 mice and AβPP-/- C57bl/6 mice. METHODS: Depolarization of acute cerebral slices from wild-type C57bl/6 and AβPP-/- C57bl/6 mice was used to induce synaptic signaling. Protein levels were examined by western blot and calcium dynamics were assessed using primary neuronal cultures. RESULTS: In the absence of AβPP decreased pCaMKII and pERKs levels were observed. This decrease was sensitive to the inhibition of N- and P/Q-type Voltage Gated Calcium Channels (N- and P/Q-VGCCs) by ω-conotoxin GVIA and ω-conotoxin MVIIC respectively but not to inhibition of L-type VGCCs by nifedipine. However the absence of AβPP did not result in a statistically significant decrease of pCREB which is a known substrate of pERKs. Finally using calcium imaging we found that down regulation of AβPP in cortical neurons results in a decreased response to depolarization and altered kinetics of calcium response. CONCLUSION: AβPP regulates synaptic activity-mediated neuronal signaling by affecting N- and P/Q-VGCCs.,NA,Department of Biology Division of Animal and Human Physiology National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Panepistimiopolis Ilisia Greece.,2020,10.3233/jad-200290,,,,pubmed-32597808,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,False,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded
1b4fc784-58b1-4312-8562-e6b1be38be5b,Drosophila as a Model to Study the Relationship Between Sleep Plasticity and Memory,"Dissel S ",Front Physiol,Front Physiol,Humans spend nearly a third of their life sleeping yet despite decades of research the function of sleep still remains a mystery. Sleep has been linked with various biological systems and functions including metabolism immunity the cardiovascular system and cognitive functions. Importantly sleep appears to be present throughout the animal kingdom suggesting that it must provide an evolutionary advantage. Among the many possible functions of sleep the relationship between sleep and cognition has received a lot of support. We have all experienced the negative cognitive effects associated with a night of sleep deprivation. These can include increased emotional reactivity poor judgment deficit in attention impairment in learning and memory and obviously increase in daytime sleepiness. Furthermore many neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease often have a sleep disorder component. In some cases the sleep disorder can exacerbate the progression of the neurological disease. Thus it is clear that sleep plays an important role for many brain functions. In particular sleep has been shown to play a positive role in the consolidation of long-term memory while sleep deprivation negatively impacts learning and memory. Importantly sleep is a behavior that is adapted to an individual's need and influenced by many external and internal stimuli. In addition to being an adaptive behavior sleep can also modulate plasticity in the brain at the level of synaptic connections between neurons and neuronal plasticity influences sleep. Understanding how sleep is modulated by internal and external stimuli and how sleep can modulate memory and plasticity is a key question in neuroscience. In order to address this question several animal models have been developed. Among them the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster with its unparalleled genetics has proved to be extremely valuable. In addition to sleep Drosophila has been shown to be an excellent model to study many complex behaviors including learning and memory. This review describes our current knowledge of the relationship between sleep plasticity and memory using the fly model.,NA,Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry School of Biological and Chemical Sciences University of Missouri-Kansas City Kansas City MO United States.,2020,10.3389/fphys.2020.00533,,,,pubmed-32547415,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,False,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b,Laurel Renton,Excluded,Excluded

J ",Neuroscience,Neuroscience,Cognitive deficits and alterations in emotional behaviour are typical features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover exposure to stress or adversity during the early life period has been associated with an acceleration of cognitive deficits and increased AD pathology in transgenic AD mouse models. Whether and how early life adversity affects fear memory in AD mice remains elusive. We therefore investigated whether exposure to early life stress (ELS) alters fear learning in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice a classic mouse model for AD and whether this is accompanied by alterations in hippocampal synaptic potentiation an important cellular substrate for learning and memory. Transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were subjected to ELS by housing the dams and her pups with limited nesting and bedding material from postnatal days 2-9. Following a fear conditioning paradigm 12-month-old ELS-exposed APPswe/PS1dE9 mice displayed enhanced contextual freezing behaviour both in the conditioning context and in a novel context. ELS-exposed APPswe/PS1dE9 mice also displayed enhanced hippocampal synaptic potentiation even in the presence of the GluN2B antagonist Ro25-6981 (which prevented synaptic potentiation in control mice). No differences in the level of PSD-95 or synaptophysin were observed between the groups. We conclude that in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice ELS increases fear memory in the conditioning context as well as a novel context which is accompanied by aberrant hippocampal synaptic potentiation. These results may help to understand how individual differences in the vulnerability to develop AD arise and emphasise the importance of the early postnatal time window in these differences.

H.Holscher C.Yang J. T.Wu M. N.Wang Z. J.Cai H. Y.Han L. N.Shi H.Han Y. F.Qi J. S ",J Alzheimers Dis,J Alzheimers Dis,BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive decline in cognitive function. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an important risk factor for AD. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) has been identified to be effective in T2DM treatment and neuroprotection. OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the neuroprotective effects and possible mechanisms of DAla2GIP-Glu-PAL a novel long-lasting GIP analogue in APP/PS1 AD mice. METHODS: Multiple behavioral tests were performed to examine the cognitive function of mice. In vivo hippocampus late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) was recorded to reflect synaptic plasticity. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to examine the Aβ plaques and neuroinflammation in the brain. IL-1β TNF-α and cAMP/PKA/CREB signal molecules were also detected by ELISA or western blotting. RESULTS: DAla2GIP-Glu-PAL increased recognition index (RI) of APP/PS1 mice in novel object recognition test elevated spontaneous alternation percentage of APP/PS1 mice in Y maze test and increased target quadrant swimming time of APP/PS1 mice in Morris water maze test. DAla2GIP-Glu-PAL treatment enhanced in vivo L-LTP of APP/PS1 mice. DAla2GIP-Glu-PAL significantly reduced Aβ deposition inhibited astrocyte and microglia proliferation and weakened IL-1β and TNF-α secretion. DAla2GIP-Glu-PAL also upregulated cAMP/PKA/CREB signal transduction and inhibited NF-κB activation in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSION: DAla2GIP-Glu-PAL can improve cognitive behavior synaptic plasticity and central pathological damage in APP/PS1 mice which might be associated with the inhibition of neuroinflammation as well as upregulation of cAMP-/PKA/CREB signaling pathway.

J.Gallegos S.Armijo-Weingart L.Araya A.Riffo-Lepe N. O.Cayuman F.Aguayo L. G ",Scientific Reports,Scientific Reports,Several previous studies showed that hippocampus and cortex are affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However other brain regions have also been found to be affected and could contribute with new critical information to the pathophysiological basis of AD. For example volumetric studies in humans have shown a significant atrophy of the striatum particularly in the nucleus Accumbens (nAc). The nAc is a key component of the limbic reward system and it is involved in cognition and emotional behaviors such as pleasure fear aggression and motivations all of which are affected in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. However its role in AD has not been extensively studied. Therefore using an AD mouse model we investigated if the nAc was affected in 6 months old transgenic 2xTg (APP/PS1) mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis in 2xTg mice showed increased intraneuronal A beta accumulation as well as occasional extracellular amyloid deposits detected through Thioflavin-S staining. Interestingly the intracellular A beta pathology was associated to an increase in membrane excitability in dissociated medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the nAc. IHC and western blot analyses showed a decrease in glycine receptors (GlyR) together with a reduction in the pre- and post-synaptic markers SV2 and gephyrin respectively which correlated with a decrease in glycinergic miniature synaptic currents in nAc brain slices. Additionally voltage-clamp recordings in dissociated MSNs showed a decrease in AMPA- and Gly-evoked currents. Overall these results showed intracellular A beta accumulation together with an increase in excitability and synaptic alterations in this mouse model. These findings provide new information that might help to explain changes in motivation anhedonia and learning in the onset of AD pathogenesis.,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000594824100033,"[Fernandez-Perez E.

The pathological mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) a common neurodegenerative disease remain largely unknown. Altered brain laterality has been demonstrated in aging people but whether or not abnormal lateralization is one of the early signs of AD has not been determined. To investigate this we recorded bilateral LFPs in 3-5-month-old AD model mice APP/PS1 together with littermate wild type (WT) controls. The LFPs of the left and right secondary motor cortex (M2) specifically in the gamma band were more synchronized in APP/PS1 mice than in WT controls suggesting a declined hemispheric asymmetry of bilateral M2 in this AD mouse model. Notably the recording and data analysis processes are flexible and easy to carry out and can also be applied to other brain pathways when conducting experiments that focus on neuronal circuits.,NA,"School of Life Sciences Guangzhou University; Institute for Brain Research and Rehabilitation South China Normal University.

Although the primary target of influenza viruses is the lung infection may manifest with acute and even chronic neurological complications (e.g. status epilepticus encephalopathies and encephalitis) potentially increasing the long-term risk for neurodegenerative diseases. We previously described that a peripheral influenza A virus (IAV) infection caused by non-neurotropic H3N2 (maHK68) variant leads to long-term neuroinflammation and synapse loss together with impaired memory formation in young adult mice. Processes of neuroinflammation have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prolonged or excessive innate immune responses are considered a risk factor for AD. Here the role of purely peripheral IAV infection for the development and progression of AD in a transgenic mouse model (APP/PS1) was investigated. At 2 months of age mice were infected with H3N2 IAV and the detailed analysis of microglia morphology revealed neuroinflammation in the hippocampus already of 6 months old non-infected APP/PS1 mice together with impaired spatial learning however microglia activation amyloid-β plaques load and cognitive impairments were even more pronounced in APP/PS1 mice upon H3N2 infection. Moreover CA1 hippocampal dendritic spine density was reduced even at 120 dpi compared to wild-type and also to non-infected APP/PS1 mice whereas neuronal cells number was not altered. These findings demonstrate that non-neurotropic H3N2 IAV infection as a peripheral immune stimulation may exacerbate AD symptoms possibly by triggering microglial hyperactivation.,NA,"Department of Cellular Neurobiology Zoological Institute TU-Braunschweig Braunschweig Germany.

The pathology propagates to neighboring cerebral regions through a prion-like mechanism. In AD intracellular calcium dyshomeostasis is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This study was designed to examine hippocampal ER stress following EC amyloidopathy. Aβ1-42 was bilaterally microinjected into the EC under stereotaxic surgery. Rats were daily treated with 30 μg of isradipine nimodipine or placebo over one week. Passive avoidance and novel object recognition (NOR) tasks were performed using shuttle box and NOR test respectively. GRP78/BiP and CHOP levels were measured in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) by western blot technique. The glutathione (GSH) level and PDI activity were also assessed in the hippocampus by colorimetric spectrophotometer. Aβ treated group developed passive avoidance and novel recognition memory deficit compared to the control group. However treatment with calcium channel blockers reversed the impairment. BiP and CHOP level increased in the hippocampus following amyloidopathy in the EC. PDI activity and GSH level in the hippocampus decreased in the Aβ treated group but calcium channel blockers restored them toward the control level. In conclusion memory impairment due to EC amyloidopathy is associated with ER stress related bio-molecular changes in the hippocampus and treatment with L-type calcium channel blockers may prevent the changes and ultimately improve cognitive performance.,NA,"Department of Physiology and Pharmacology Pasteur Institute of Iran Tehran Iran.

However global cholesterol-lowering therapies have yielded mixed results when it comes to slowing down or preventing cognitive decline in AD. We used the transgenic mouse model Cyp27Tg with systemically high levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH) to examine long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 region combined with dendritic spine reconstruction of CA1 pyramidal neurons to detect morphological and functional synaptic alterations induced by 27-OH high levels. Our results show that elevated 27-OH levels lead to enhanced LTP in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. This increase is correlated with abnormally large dendritic spines in the stratum radiatum. Using immunohistochemistry for synaptopodin (actin-binding protein involved in the recruitment of the spine apparatus) we found a significantly higher density of synaptopodin-positive puncta in CA1 in Cyp27Tg mice. We hypothesize that high 27-OH levels alter synaptic potentiation and could lead to dysfunction of fine-tuned processing of information in hippocampal circuits resulting in cognitive impairment. We suggest that these alterations could be detrimental for synaptic function and cognition later in life representing a potential mechanism by which hypercholesterolemia could lead to alterations in memory function in neurodegenerative diseases.,NA,"Department of Neurobiology Care Sciences and Society Division of Neurogeriatrics Center for Alzheimer Research Karolinska Institutet Stockholm Sweden.

Chen;Shayna N. Mason;Diana M. Rigan;Jacquelin F. Kwentus;John M. Hayes;Emily D. Glass;Evan L. Reynolds;Geoffrey G. Murphy;Eva L. Feldman,CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,NA,"Background As the field of stem cell therapy advances, it is important to develop reliable methods to overcome host immune responses in animal models. This ensures survival of transplanted human stem cell grafts and enables predictive efficacy testing. Immunosuppressive drugs derived from clinical protocols are frequently used but are often inconsistent and associated with toxic side effects. Here, using a molecular imaging approach, we show that immunosuppression targeting costimulatory molecules CD4 and CD40L enables robust survival of human xenografts in mouse brain, as compared to conventional tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Methods Human neural stem cells were modified to express green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase. Cells were implanted in the fimbria fornix of the hippocampus and viability assessed by non-invasive bioluminescent imaging. Cell survival was assessed using traditional pharmacologic immunosuppression as compared to monoclonal antibodies directed against CD4 and CD40L. This paradigm was also implemented in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Results Graft rejection occurs within 7 days in non-immunosuppressed mice and within 14 days in mice on a traditional regimen. The addition of dual monoclonal antibody immunosuppression extends graft survival past 7 weeks (p < .001) on initial studies. We confirm dual monoclonal antibody treatment is superior to either antibody alone (p < .001). Finally, we demonstrate robust xenograft survival at multiple cell doses up to 6 months in both C57BL/6J mice and a transgenic Alzheimer's disease model (p < .001). The dual monoclonal antibody protocol demonstrated no significant adverse effects, as determined by complete blood counts and toxicity screen. Conclusions This study demonstrates an effective immunosuppression protocol for preclinical testing of stem cell therapies. A transition towards antibody-based strategies may be advantageous by enabling stem cell survival in preclinical studies that could inform future clinical trials.",NA,NA,2022,10.1002/ctm2.1046,,,,wos:000853271000001,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,False,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

Serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) have a critical effect on various regulatory mechanisms involved in synaptic plasticity learning and memory. Okadaic acid (OKA) a potent inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A reportedly leads to cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of OKA on electrophysiological characteristics of hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) neurons in vivo. Male Wistar rats were divided into two control and OKA groups. OKA was injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) into lateral ventricles and after two weeks the long-term potentiation (LTP) and paired-pulse responses recorded from hippocampal perforant path-DG synapses in order to assess short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity. Results of this study revealed that OKA-induced inhibition of PP1 and PP2A activity drastically attenuates the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slope and population spike (PS) amplitude following paired pulse and high frequency stimulation (HFS) of hippocampal DG neurons indicating pre- and post-synaptic involvement in electrical activity of these neurons. Administration of OKA impaired the short-term and long-term spatial memories conducted by Y-maze and passive avoidance tests respectively. OKA-induced attenuation in electrophysiological activity and consequent memory deficits also provide a beneficial tool for studying neurodegenerative disorders such as AD.,NA,"Department of Physiology School of Medicine Ardabil University of Medical Sciences Ardabil Iran.

N ",Front Aging Neurosci,Front Aging Neurosci,Hypertension is recognized as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease but the causal link remains undetermined. Although astrocytes and microglia play an important role in maintaining the neurovascular unit astrocytes and microglia have been understudied in comorbid models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease. In this study male transgenic Fischer 344 rats (TgAPP21) overexpressing a pathogenic human amyloid precursor protein received 8 weeks of Angiotensin II infusion to increase blood pressure and the rats were evaluated for astrocytosis microgliosis and cognitive function. A linear relationship between astrocytosis and blood pressure was observed in the corpus callosum and cingulum of wildtype rats with hypertensive wildtype rats matching the elevated baseline astrocytosis seen in normotensive transgenic rats. In contrast hypertensive transgenic rats did not demonstrate a further increase of astrocytosis suggesting a deficient response. Angiotensin II infusion did not affect activation of microglia which were elevated in the white matter and hippocampus of transgenic rats. Angiotensin II infusion did impair both wildtype and transgenic rats' executive functions in the Morris Water Maze. These results present important implications for the interaction between hypertension and pathogenic human amyloid precursor protein expression as Angiotensin II infusion produced cognitive impairments in both genotypes but transgenic rats were additionally impaired in developing a normal astrocytic response to elevated blood pressure.,NA,"Vulnerable Brain Lab Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry Western University London ON Canada.

C ",Neurobiol Dis,Neurobiol Dis,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative disease. Although neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid beta are classic hallmarks of AD the earliest deficits in AD progression may be caused by unknown factors. One suspected factor has to do with brain energy metabolism. To investigate this factor brain metabolic activity in 3xTg-AD mice and age-matched controls were measured with FDG-PET. Significant hypometabolic changes (p < .01) in brain metabolism were detected in the cortical piriform and insular regions of AD brains relative to controls. These regions are associated with olfaction which is a potential clinical marker for AD progression as well as neurogenesis. The activity of the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex IV) and the expression of complex I-V were significantly decreased (p < .05) suggesting that impaired metabolic activity coupled with impaired oxidative phosphorylation leads to decreased mitochondrial bioenergetics and subsequent Neurodegeneration. Although there is an association between neuroinflammatory pathological markers (microglial) and hypometabolism in AD there was no association found between neuropathological (Aβ tau and astrocytes) and functional changes in AD sensitive brain regions also suggesting that brain hypometabolism occurs prior to AD pathology. Therefore targeting metabolic mechanisms in cortical piriform and insular regions at early stages may be a promising approach for preventing slowing and/or blocking the onset of AD and preserving neurogenesis.,NA,"St. Boniface Hospital Research Canada; Dept. of Pharmacology & Therapeutics University of Manitoba Canada.

M ",Contemporary Clinical Trials,Contemporary Clinical Trials,Lifestyle interventions to increase exercise and improve diet have been the focus of recent clinical trials to potentially prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD). However despite the strong links between sleep disruptions cognitive decline and AD sleep enhancement has yet to be targeted as a lifestyle intervention to prevent AD. A recent meta-analysis suggests that approximately 15% of AD may be prevented by an efficacious intervention aimed to reduce sleep disturbances and sleep disorders. Chronic insomnia is the most frequent sleep disorder occurring in at least 40% of older adults. Individuals with insomnia are more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and demonstrate decline in cognitive function at long-term follow-up. AD is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques and tau tangles in the brain and growing evidence shows impaired sleep contributes to the accumulation of A beta. An intervention aimed at improving insomnia may be a critical opportunity for primary prevention to slow cognitive decline and potentially delay the onset of AD. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is an efficacious treatment for insomnia but the use of CBT-I to improve cognitive function and potentially reduce the rate of A beta accumulation has never been examined. Therefore the objective of the proposed study is to examine the efficacy of CBT-I on improving cognitive function in older adults with symptoms of insomnia.

L.Combs C. K ",J Alzheimers Dis,J Alzheimers Dis,BACKGROUND: Although it is known that the brain communicates with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract via the well-established gut-brain axis the influence exerted by chronic intestinal inflammation on brain changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not fully understood. We hypothesized that increased gut inflammation would alter brain pathology of a mouse model of AD. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether colitis exacerbates AD-related brain changes. METHODS: To test this idea 2% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) was dissolved in the drinking water and fed ad libitum to male C57BL/6 wild type and AppNL-G-F mice at 6-10 months of age for two cycles of three days each. DSS is a negatively charged sulfated polysaccharide which results in bloody diarrhea and weight loss changes similar to human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). RESULTS: Both wild type and AppNL-G-F mice developed an IBD-like condition. Brain histologic and biochemical assessments demonstrated increased insoluble Aβ1-40/42 levels along with the decreased microglial CD68 immunoreactivity in DSS treated AppNL-G-F mice compared to vehicle treated AppNL-G-F mice. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that intestinal dysfunction is capable of altering plaque deposition and glial immunoreactivity in the brain.

Urolithin B (UB) one of the major subcategories of urolithins (microbiota metabolites) found in various tissues after ellagitannin consumption has been shown to possess antioxidant anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects. However the neuroprotective effect of UB on brain aging in mice and its potential mechanisms were still unknown. Methods: In the current research we first assessed the ameliorative effects of UB on oxidative injury and apoptosis induced by H(2)O(2) in neuro-2a cells. Then a subcutaneous injection of D-galactose in mice for 8 weeks was used to establish the aging model to evaluate the protective effects of UB. The capacity of memory and learning alterations of hippocampus histology and corresponding molecular mechanisms were all evaluated. Results: The D-gal-induced accelerated aging model in vivo demonstrated that UB could significantly ameliorate deficits in learning and memory by inhibiting the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and elevating the expression and activity of Cu Zn-SOD and CAT. Furthermore UB downregulated the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway and prevented cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria thereby inhibiting neuronal apoptosis during the aging process. More importantly UB stimulation of aging mice activated ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) leading to neuronal survival along with Akt and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and activation. Conclusion: In summary UB effectively alleviated cognitive deficits and ameliorated brain aging-related conditions and could be considered a healthcare product to prevent aging-associated NDs such as AD.,NA,"Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery Ministry of Education Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences Wuhan China.

0df742e8-3e88-421f-b8bd-a8f08d31d1ac,The synapse as a treatment avenue for Alzheimer's Disease.,L Peng;I Bestard-Lorigados;W Song,Mol Psychiatry,NA,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with devastating symptoms, including memory impairments and cognitive deficits. Hallmarks of AD pathology are amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition forming neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). For many years, AD drug development has mainly focused on directly targeting the Aβ aggregation or the formation of tau tangles, but this disease has no cure so far. Other common characteristics of AD are synaptic abnormalities and dysfunctions such as synaptic damage, synaptic loss, and structural changes in the synapse. Those anomalies happen in the early stages of the disease before behavioural symptoms have occurred. Therefore, better understanding the mechanisms underlying the synaptic dysfunction found in AD and targeting the synapse, especially using early treatment windows, can lead to finding novel and more effective treatments that could improve the lives of AD patients. Researchers have recently started developing different disease-modifying treatments targeting the synapse to rescue and prevent synaptic dysfunction in AD. The main objectives of these new strategies are to halt synaptic loss, strengthen synaptic connections, and improve synaptic density, potentially leading to the rescue or prevention of cognitive impairments. This article aims to address the mechanisms of synaptic degeneration in AD and discuss current strategies that focus on the synapse for AD therapy. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impairs memory and causes cognitive and behavioural deficits. Scientists worldwide have tried to find a treatment that can reverse or rescue AD symptoms, but there is no cure so far. One prominent characteristic of AD is the brain atrophy caused by significant synaptic loss and overall neuronal damage, which starts at the early stages of the disease before other AD hallmarks such as neuritic plaques and NFTs. The present review addresses the underlying mechanisms behind synaptic loss and dysfunction in AD and discusses potential strategies that target the synapse.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35444256,NA,2022,10.1038/s41380-022-01565-z,,,,pubmed-35444256,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,False,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b,Laurel Renton,Excluded,Excluded

It is characterized by progressive deterioration of memory and cognition. Many new potential targets are being investigated to develop effective therapeutic strategies for AD. Neuropeptide S (NPS) is an endogenous peptide in the central nervous system which has been shown to play a beneficial role in learning and memory. However whether NPS can ameliorate cognitive deficits in AD remains unclear. In this study we examined the effects of NPS treatment on the cognitive behaviors and pathological hallmarks in 8-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) AD mice. We found that the APP/PS1 mice exhibited lower levels of NPS receptors (NPSRs) in the hippocampal area and NPS administration increased c-Fos expression in the hippocampus and cortex which suggests the NPS/NPSR system may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. After an intracerebroventricular injection of NPS (1 nmol) for 2 weeks we found NPS treatment ameliorated spatial memory deficits and promoted dendrite ramification and spine generation in hippocampal CA1 neurons which was accompanied by the upregulation of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and synapsin1. We also demonstrated that the injection of NPS decreased Aβ plaque deposits by decreasing the γ-secretase activity and the phosphorylation of APP at Thr668. Furthermore application of NPS reversed the deficits in hippocampal late-phase long-term potentiation (LTP). These findings suggest NPS attenuated cognitive deficits by reducing pathological features in APP/PS1 mice and NPS might be a potential therapeutic agent for AD.,NA,"Wuxi Medical School Jiangnan University Wuxi China.

WBV has been extensively investigated through clinical studies with main focus on the musculoskeletal system. However, pre-clinical data in the context of behavior, memory and motor functions with aged rodents are limited. The aim of this experiment was to investigate the dose dependent effects of a five weeks long WBV intervention with an aged animal model including anxiety-related behavior, memory and motor functions, as well as markers of (neuro)inflammation. Male Wistar rats (18 months) underwent 5 or 20 min daily vibration exposure or pseudo-treatment (i.e.: being subjected to the same environmental stimuli for 5 or 20 min, but without exposure to vibrations) 5 times per week. After 5 weeks treatment, cognitive functions, anxiety-like behavior and motor performance were evaluated. Finally, brain tissue was collected for immunohistological purposes to evaluate hippocampal (neuro)inflammation. Animals with 20 min daily session of WBV showed a decrease in their anxiety-like behavior and improvement in their spatial memory. Muscle strength in the grip hanging test was only significantly improved by 5 min daily WBV treatments, whereas motor coordination in the balance beam test was not significantly altered. Microglia activation showed a significant decrease in the CA1 and Dentate gyrus subregions by both dose of WBV. In contrast, these effects were less pronounced in the CA3 and Hilus subregions, where only 5 min dose showed a significant effect on microglia activation.

Drp1 activation via S616 phosphorylation rescues deficits of spine maturation in Pink1 KO neurons. Notably, mice harboring a knockin (KI) phosphor-null Drp1S616A recapitulate spine immaturity and synaptic abnormality identified in Pink1 KO mice.

Long-Evans male rats were injected with the cholinergic immunotoxin 192 IgG-saporin into the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (0.37 µg); vehicle injections served as controls. Immediately after surgery, OTR4132 was injected into the lateral ventricles (0.25 µg/5 µl/rat) or intramuscularly (1.5 mg/kg). To determine whether OTR4132 reached the lesion site, some rats received intracerebroventricular (ICV) or intramuscular (I.M.) injections of fluorescent OTR4132. Rats were sacrificed at 4, 10, 20, or 60 days post-lesion (DPL). Fluorescein-labeled OTR4132 injected ICV or I.M. was found in the lesion from 4 to 20 DPL. Rats with partial hippocampal cholinergic denervation showed decreases in hippocampal acetylcholinesterase reaction products and in choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons in the medial septum. These lesions were the largest at 10 DPL and then remained stable until 60 DPL. Both hippocampal acetylcholinesterase reaction products and choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons in the medial septum effects were significantly attenuated in OTR4132-treated rats. These effects were not related to competition between OTR4132 and 192 IgG-saporin for the neurotrophin receptor P75 (p75 NTR ), as OTR4132 treatment did not alter the internalization of Cy3-labelled 192 IgG. OTR4132 was more efficient at reducing the acetylcholinesterase reaction products and choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons than a comparable heparin dose used as a comparator. Using the slice superfusion technique, we found that the lesion-induced decrease in muscarinic autoreceptor sensitivity was abolished by intramuscular OTR4132.

J.Wehr M ",Neurobiology of Aging,Neurobiology of Aging,Early detection will be crucial for effective treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease. The identification and validation of early noninvasive biomarkers is therefore key to avoiding the most devastating aspects of Alzheimer's disease. Measures of central auditory processing such as gap detection have recently emerged as potential biomarkers in both human patients and the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Full validation of gap detection deficits as a biomarker will require detailed understanding of the underlying neuropathology including which brain structures are involved and how the operation of neural circuits is affected. Here we show that 5XFAD mice exhibit gap detection deficits as early as 2 months of age well before development of Alzheimer's disease-associated pathology. We then examined responses of neurons in the auditory cortex to gaps in white noise. Both gap responses and baseline firing rates were robustly and progressively degraded in 5XFAD mice compared to litter mate controls. These impairments were first evident at 2-4 months of age in males and 4-6 months in females. This demonstrates early-onset impairments to the central auditory system which could be due to damage in the auditory cortex upstream subcortical structures or both. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Persistent low-grade inflammation may contribute to DR. Increased salt intake has been shown to promote autoimmunity in the brain. This study determined the role of salt intake in DR development. Methods: Eight-week-old C57BL/6 J male mice received streptozotocin to induce diabetes. Diabetic or non-diabetic mice were fed a diet containing normal, low and high amounts of salt. The retinal function, structure and inflammatory response were determined 8 weeks after the establishment of diabetes. Interleukin (IL)-1β or a NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inhibitor was injected intravitreally and the retinal changes were evaluated. Results: A high salt diet worsened the functional and structural damage of retinal cells and increased IL-1β in the retina of diabetic mice. IL-1β injection impaired the function of photoreceptors and retinal structure in the diabetic mice. Blocking NLRP3 inhibited IL-1β increase in the mouse bone marrow macrophages cultured in high sodium medium. NLRP3 inhibition attenuated retinal injury of diabetic mice on high salt diet. A low-salt diet also triggered inflammation and cell damage in the retina of diabetic mice but at a lower grade than those induced by high salt diet. A low or high salt diet for 8 weeks did not induce inflammation or cell injury in the retina of mice without diabetes. Conclusion: These results indicate that high salt intake has deleterious effects in DR development through NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the subsequent production of IL-1β.

P ",Aging Cell,Aging Cell,Age-related cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the deficits of synaptic plasticity. Therefore exploring promising targets to enhance synaptic plasticity in neurodegenerative disorders is crucial. It has been demonstrated that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) plays a vital role in neuronal development and MeCP2 malfunction causes various neurodevelopmental disorders. However the role of MeCP2 in neurodegenerative diseases has been less reported. In the study we found that MeCP2 expression in the hippocampus was reduced in the hippocampus of senescence-accelerated mice P8 (SAMP8) mice. Overexpression of hippocampal MeCP2 could elevate synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in SAMP8 mice while knockdown of MeCP2 impaired synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in senescence accelerated-resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice. MeCP2-mediated regulation of synaptic plasticity may be associated with CREB1 pathway. These results suggest that MeCP2 plays a vital role in age-related cognitive decline by regulating synaptic plasticity and indicate that MeCP2 may be promising targets for the treatment of age-related cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases.,NA,"Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy Pharmacy School of Xuzhou Medical University Xuzhou China.

However increasing data is suggesting that brain network alterations rather than protein deposition could account for the early pathogenesis of the disease. In the present study we performed in vitro extracellular field recordings in the CA1/subiculum area of the hippocampus from 30 days old J20-TG-AD mice. Here we found that theta oscillations were significantly less rhythmic than those recorded from control group. In addition J20 mice displayed significantly less theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling (CFC) as peak modulation indexes for slow (25-45 Hz) and fast (150-250 Hz) gamma frequency oscillations were reduced. Because inhibitory parvalbumin (PV) cells play a vital role in coordinating hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and extracellular stimulation were performed to access their intrinsic and synaptic properties. Whereas neither the inhibitory output of local interneurons to pyramidal cells (PCs) (inhibitory→PC) nor the excitatory output of PCs to PV cells (PC→PV) differed between control and J20 animals the intrinsic excitability of PV cells was reduced in J20 mice compared to controls. Interestingly optogenetic activation of PV interneurons which can directly drive theta oscillations in the hippocampus did not rescue CFC impairments suggesting the latter did not simply result from alteration of the underlying theta rhythm. Altered young J20 mice was characterized by the presence of β-CTF but not with Aβ accumulation in the hippocampus. Importantly the β secretase inhibitor AZD3839-AstraZeneca significantly rescued the abnormal early electrophysiological phenotype of J20 mice. In conclusion our data show that brain network alterations precede the canonical Aβ protein deposition and that such alterations can be related to β-CTF fragment.,NA,"Department of Psychiatry Douglas Mental Health University Institute McGill University Montreal QC Canada.

Surprisingly however cognitive functions are improved in AD models after ablating adult neural stem cells (aNSCs). Ablation of aNSCs does not affect the levels of amyloid β but restores the normal synaptic transmission in the dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells of AD models. Furthermore calbindin depletion in the DG of AD mice is ameliorated after aNSC ablation and knocking down calbindin abolishes the effects of aNSC ablation on synaptic and cognitive functions of AD mice. Together our data suggest that cognitive functions of AD mice are improved after aNSC ablation which is associated with the restoration of synaptic transmission in the DG granule cells with calbindin as an important mediator.,NA,"Department of Neurobiology and Department of Neurology of the First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou Zhejiang Province 310058 China; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology Medical School of Ningbo University Ningbo Zhejiang Province 315211 China.

However, OLV may also increase CERO2 and aggravate delayed cognitive recovery. Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on cognitive function in rats undergoing OLV. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two-lung ventilation (TLV) group, OLV group and OLV treated with DEX group. Group DEX received 25 μg/kg DEX i.p. 30 min before induction. After mechanical ventilation (MV), Morris water maze (MWM) test was carried out to examine spatial memory function. Western blotting was used to detect pERK1/2, pCREB, Bcl-2 and BAX in hippocampal tissues. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the hippocampal CA1 region. Results: Post-MV, compared with group OLV, group DEX showed increases in percentage of target quadrant time (P < 0.05), platform crossings (P < 0.05), a reduction in CERO2 (P < 0.05), and pERK1/2, pCREB, and Bcl-2 significantly increased (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), while BAX significantly decreased (P < 0.01), besides, a less damaged synaptic structure was observed in group DEX.

In the human cortex however direct experimental evidence for coordinated structural and functional synaptic adaptation is currently lacking. Here we probed synaptic plasticity in human cortical slices using the vitamin A derivative all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) a putative treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Our experiments demonstrated that the excitatory synapses of superficial (layer 2/3) pyramidal neurons underwent coordinated structural and functional changes in the presence of atRA. These synaptic adaptations were accompanied by ultrastructural remodeling of the calcium-storing spine apparatus organelle and required mRNA translation. It was not observed in synaptopodin-deficient mice which lack spine apparatus organelles. We conclude that atRA is a potent mediator of synaptic plasticity in the adult human cortex.
The brain has an enormous capacity to adapt to its environment. This ability to continuously learn and form new memories thanks to its malleability is known as brain plasticity. One of the most important mechanisms behind brain plasticity is the change in both the structure and function of synapses the points of contact between neurons where communication happens. These sites of synaptic contact occur through microscopic protrusions on the branches of neurons called dendritic spines. Dendritic spines are very dynamic changing their shape and size in response to stimuli. Previous studies have shown that alterations in synaptic plasticity occur in various animal models of brain diseases. However it remains unclear whether human cortical neurons express synaptic plasticity similarly to those in the rodent brain. Recently a derivative of vitamin A has been linked to synaptic plasticity. In addition several studies have evaluated the effects of this derivative in patients with cognitive dysfunctions including Alzheimer’s disease Fragile X syndrome and depression. However there is no direct experimental evidence for synaptic plasticity in the adult human cerebral cortex related to vitamin A signaling and metabolism. To investigate this Lenz et al. used human cortical slices prepared from neurosurgical resections and treated them with a solution of the vitamin A derivative all-trans retinoic acid for 6-10 hours. Lenz et al. employed a variety of techniques including patch-clamp recordings to measure neuron function as well as different types of microscopy to evaluate structural changes in dendritic spines. These experiments demonstrated that the derivative promoted the synaptic plasticity in the adult human cortex. Specifically it increased the size of the dendritic spines and strengthened their ability to transmit signals. In addition Lenz et al. found that the spine apparatus organelle – a structure found in some dendritic spines – was a target of the vitamin A derivative and promoted synaptic plasticity. These findings advance the understanding of the pathways through which vitamin A derivatives affect synaptic plasticity which may aide the development of new therapeutic strategies for brain diseases. More generally the results contribute to the identification of key mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in the adult human brain.

A.Degan S.Hoffmann U.Galeffi F.Colton C. A ",Alzheimers Dement,Alzheimers Dement,We compared the efficacy of neurovascular coupling and substrate supply in cerebral cortex during severe metabolic challenges in transgenic Alzheimer's [CVN-AD] and control [C57Bl/6] mice to evaluate the hypothesis that metabolic insufficiency is a critical component of degeneration leading to dementia. We analyzed cerebral blood flow and metabolic responses to spreading depression (induced by K(+) applied to the cortex) and anoxia across aging in CVN-AD + C57Bl/6 genotypes. In the CVN-AD genotype progression to histological and cognitive hallmarks of dementia is a stereotyped function of age. We correlated physiology and imaging of the cortex with the blood flow responses measured with laser doppler probes. The results show that spreading depression resulted in a hyperemic blood flow response that was dramatically reduced (24% in amplitude 70% in area) in both middle-aged and aged CVN-AD mice compared to C57Bl/6 age-matched controls. However spreading depression amplitude and conduction velocity (≈6 mm/min) did not differ among groups. Anoxia (100% N(2) ) showed significantly decreased (by 62%) reactive blood flow and autoregulation in aged AD-CVN mice compared to aged control animals. Significantly reduced neurovascular coupling occurred prematurely with aging in CVN-AD mice. Abbreviated physiological hyperemia and decreased resilience to anoxia may enhance early-onset metabolic deficiency through decreased substrate supply to the brain. Metabolic deficiency may contribute significantly to the degeneration associated with dementia as a function of aging and regions of the brain involved.,NA,"Neurosurgery Box 3807 Duke University Medical Center Durham North Carolina 27710 USA.

M ",Handb Exp Pharmacol,Handb Exp Pharmacol,The cellular processes regulated by WNT signaling have been mainly studied during embryonic development and cancer. In the last two decades the role of WNT in the adult central nervous system has been the focus of interest in our laboratory. In this chapter we will be summarized β-catenin-dependent and -independent WNT pathways then we will be revised WNT signaling function at the pre- and post-synaptic level. Concerning Alzheimer's disease (AD) initially we found that WNT/β-catenin signaling activation exerts a neuroprotective mechanism against the amyloid β (Αβ) peptide toxicity. Later we found that WNT/β-catenin participates in Tau phosphorylation and in learning and memory. In the last years we demonstrated that WNT/β-catenin signaling is instrumental in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and that WNT/β-catenin dysfunction results in Aβ production and aggregation. We highlight the importance of WNT/β-catenin signaling dysfunction in the onset of AD and propose that the loss of WNT/β-catenin signaling is a triggering factor of AD. The WNT pathway is therefore positioned as a therapeutic target for AD and could be a valid concept for improving AD therapy. We think that metabolism and inflammation will be relevant when defining future research in the context of WNT signaling and the neurodegeneration associated with AD.,NA,"Centro de Envejecimiento y Regeneración (CARE UC) Departamento de Biología Celular y Molecular Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile Santiago Chile. ninestrosa@bio.puc.cl.

Mutations in RyR2 are associated with both cardiac arrhythmias and intellectual disability. While the mechanisms of RyR2-linked arrhythmias are well characterized, little is known about the mechanism underlying RyR2-associated intellectual disability. Here, we employed a mouse model expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged RyR2 and a specific GFP probe to determine the subcellular localization of RyR2 in hippocampus. GFP-RyR2 was predominantly detected in the soma and dendrites, but not the dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons or dentate gyrus granular neurons. GFP-RyR2 was also detected within the mossy fibers in the stratum lucidum of CA3, but not in the presynaptic terminals of CA1 neurons. An arrhythmogenic RyR2-R4496C+/− mutation downregulated the A-type K+ current and increased membrane excitability, but had little effect on the afterhyperpolarization current or presynaptic facilitation of CA1 neurons. The RyR2-R4496C+/− mutation also impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation, learning, and memory.

W.Gyengesi E.Buskila Y ",Brain Struct Funct,Brain Struct Funct,The medial septal nucleus is one of the basal forebrain nuclei that projects cholinergic input to the hippocampus and cortex. Two of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are a significant loss of cholinergic transmission and neuroinflammation and it has been suggested that these two hallmarks are causally linked to the medial septum. Therefore we have investigated the age-related susceptibility of medial septal cholinergic neurons to glial activation mediated via peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide (500 μg/kg) into ChAT(BAC)-eGFP mice at different ages (3-22 months). Our results show that during normal aging cholinergic neurons experience a bi-phasic excitability profile in which increased excitability at adulthood (ages ranging between 9 and 12 months) decreases in aged animals (> 18 months). Moreover activation of glia had a differential impact on mice from different age groups affecting K(+) conductances in young and adult animals without affecting aged mice. These findings provide a potential explanation for the increased vulnerability of cholinergic neurons to neuroinflammation with aging as reported previously thus providing a link to the impact of acute neuroinflammation in AD.,NA,"School of Medicine Western Sydney University Campbelltown NSW 2560 Australia.

W.Maezawa I ",Glia,Glia,Microglia show a rich repertoire of activation patterns regulated by a complex ensemble of surface ion channels receptors and transporters. We and others have investigated whether microglia vary their K(+) channel expression as a means to achieve functional diversity. However most of the prior studies were conducted using in vitro models such as BV2 cells primary microglia or brain slices in culture which may not accurately reflect microglia physiology in adult individuals. Here we employed an in vivo mouse model of selective innate immune activation by intracerebroventricular injection of lipopolysaccharides (ICV-LPS) to determine the role of the voltage-gated Kv1.3 channel in LPS-induced M1-like microglial activation. Using microglia acutely isolated from adult brains we detected Kv1.3 and Kir2.1 currents and found that ICV-LPS increased the current density and RNA expression of Kv1.3 but did not affect those of Kir2.1. Genetic knockout of Kv1.3 abolished LPS-induced microglial activation exemplified by Iba-1 immunoreactivity and expression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β TNF-α IL-6 and iNOS. Moreover Kv1.3 knockout mitigated the LPS-induced impairment of hippocampal long-term potentiation (hLTP) suggesting that Kv1.3 activity regulates pro-inflammatory microglial neurotoxicity. Pharmacological intervention using PAP-1 a small molecule that selectively blocks homotetrameric Kv1.3 channels achieved anti-inflammatory and hLTP-recovery effects similar to Kv1.3 knockout. We conclude that Kv1.3 is required for microglial M1-like pro-inflammatory activation in vivo. A significant implication of our in vivo data is that Kv1.3 blockers could be therapeutic candidates for neurological diseases where microglia-mediated neurotoxicity is implicated in the pathogenesis.,NA,"From the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and M.I.N.D.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes are positively associated with the development of premature cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease linking diet with these conditions. Here we demonstrate that in mice episodic memory together with spatial and contextual associative memory is compromised after only one day of high-fat diet. However object memory remains intact. This shows not only a more rapid effect than previously reported but also that more complex memories are at higher risk of being compromised by a high-fat diet. In addition we show that these memory deficits are rapidly reversed by switching mice from a high-fat diet back to a low-fat diet.

We found that a brief 30 min restraint stress protocol reversed the impaired LTP assessed with field excitatory postsynaptic potential recordings at cornu ammonis 3-1 (CA3-CA1) synapses in both Tg2576 and 5XFAD mice. This effect was accompanied by increased phosphorylation and surface expression of glutamate A1 (GluA1) -containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs). Moreover enhanced LTP induction and GluA1 phosphorylation were sustained up to 4 h after the stress. Treatment with 200 nM dexamethasone produced similar effects in the hippocampi of these mice which supports the glucocorticoid receptor-mediated mechanism in these models.

W.Namkoong K.Kim E ",Psychiatry Investig,Psychiatry Investig,OBJECTIVE: Conventional methods for organotypic hippocampal tissue slice culture (OHSC) have shown several disadvantages or limitations regarding age of animals used duration of culture and difficulty using neurodegenerative models. Therefore we tried to establish OHSC from old 3xTg-Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice for longer period (over 4 weeks) and to validate utility of this system as a valid platform for translational neuroscience of AD. METHODS: OHSC was performed with old 3xTg-AD mice (12-14 months) old wild type mice (12-14 months) and young 3xTg-AD mice (2-4 months) using serum-free medium for 4 weeks. Hippocampal structure was evaluated by 4' 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) intensity and neuronal metabolism was measured by Alamarblue assay. Pathologic characteristics of AD were also investigated; β-amyloid levels by ELISA amyloid plaque deposition by Thioflavin-S staining and glial activation by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Following 4-week culture in serum-free media hippocampal cells and layers were well preserved in cultured slices from old AD mice as was in those from young AD and old wild type mice. On the contrary excessive regression of total visible cells was observed in conventional serum-containing medium regardless of genotype of mice. In parallel with this well preserved structure major pathologic characteristics of AD were also well manifested in hippocampal slices from old AD mice. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that long-term OHSC from old 3xTg-AD mouse can serve as a promising ex vivo system for studies on pathophysiology of AD especially with the minimum number of sacrifice of experimental animals.,NA,"Department of Psychiatry Yonsei University College of Medicine Seoul Republic of Korea.

R ",ASN Neuro,ASN Neuro,Alzheimer’s disease (AD) ranks sixth on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Top 10 Leading Causes of Death list for 2016 and the Alzheimer’s Association attributes 60% to 80% of dementia cases as AD related. AD pathology hallmarks include accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles; however evidence supports that soluble amyloid beta (Aβ) rather than insoluble plaques may instigate synaptic failure. Soluble Aβ accumulation results in depression of long-term potentiation leading to cognitive deficits commonly characterized in AD. The mechanisms through which Aβ incites cognitive decline have been extensively explored with a growing body of evidence pointing to modulation of the glutamatergic system. The period of glutamatergic hypoactivation observed alongside long-term potentiation depression and cognitive deficits in later disease stages may be the consequence of a preceding period of increased glutamatergic activity. This review will explore the Aβ-related changes to the tripartite glutamate synapse resulting in altered cell signaling throughout disease progression ultimately culminating in oxidative stress synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss.,NA,"1 Department of Neurology Center for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Neuroscience Institute Southern Illinois University School of Medicine Springfield IL USA.

The aim of this study was to study the long-term brain distribution of two radiolabeled monoclonal A beta antibody variants - RmAb158 the recombinant murine version of BAN2401 which has recently demonstrated amyloid removal and reduced cognitive decline in AD patients and the bispecific RmAb158-scFv8D3 which has been engineered for enhanced brain uptake via transferrin receptor-mediated transcytosis. Methods A single intravenous injection of iodine-125 (I-125)-labeled RmAb158-scFv8D3 or RmAb158 was administered to AD transgenic mice (tg-ArcSwe). In vivo single-photon emission computed tomography was used to investigate brain retention and intrabrain distribution of the antibodies over a period of 4 weeks. Activity in blood and brain tissue was measured ex vivo and autoradiography was performed in combination with A beta and CD31 immunostaining to investigate the intrabrain distribution of the antibodies and their interactions with A beta. Results Despite faster blood clearance [I-125]RmAb158-scFv8D3 displayed higher brain exposure than [I-125]RmAb158 throughout the study. The brain distribution of [I-125]RmAb158-scFv8D3 was more uniform and coincided with parenchymal A beta pathology while [I-125]RmAb158 displayed a more scattered distribution pattern and accumulated in central parts of the brain at later times. Ex vivo autoradiography indicated greater vascular escape and parenchymal A beta interactions for [I-125]RmAb158-scFv8D3 whereas [I-125]RmAb158 displayed retention and A beta interactions in lateral ventricles. Conclusions The high brain uptake and uniform intrabrain distribution of RmAb158-scFv8D3 highlight the benefits of receptor-mediated transcytosis for antibody-based brain imaging. Moreover it suggests that the alternative transport route of the bispecific antibody contributes to improved efficacy of brain-directed immunotherapy.,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000574243200002,"[Gustavsson Tobias; Syvanen Stina; Sehlin Dag] Uppsala Univ Dept Publ Hlth & Caring Sci Uppsala Sweden.

However, a majority of studies focus on the individual pathologies and seldom on the interaction between the two pathologies. Herein, we present the longitudinal neuropathological and neurophysiological effects of a combined amyloid-tau model by hippocampal seeding of human-derived tau pathology in the APP.PS1/L166P amyloid animal model. We statistically assessed both neurophysiological and pathological changes using linear mixed modelling to determine if factors such as the age at which animals were seeded, genotype, seeding or buffer, brain region where pathology was quantified, and time-post injection differentially affect these outcomes. We report that AT8-positive tau pathology progressively develops and is facilitated by the amount of amyloid pathology present at the time of injection. The amount of AT8-positive tau pathology was influenced by the interaction of age at which the animal was injected, genotype, and time after injection. Baseline pathology-related power spectra and Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD) score alterations were noted in APP.PS1/L166P before any manipulations were performed, indicating a baseline difference associated with genotype. We also report immediate localized hippocampal dysfunction in the electroencephalography (EEG) power spectra associated with tau seeding which returned to comparable levels at 1 month-post-injection. Longitudinal effects of seeding indicated that tau-seeded wild-type mice showed an increase in gamma power earlier than buffer control comparisons which was influenced by the age at which the animal was injected. A reduction of hippocampal broadband power spectra was noted in tau-seeded wild-type mice, but absent in APP.PS1 animals. HFD scores appeared to detect subtle effects associated with tau seeding in APP.PS1 animals, which was differentially influenced by genotype. Notably, while tau histopathological changes were present, a lack of overt longitudinal electrophysiological alterations was noted, particularly in APP.PS1 animals that feature both pathologies after seeding, reiterating and underscoring the difficulty and complexity associated with elucidating physiologically relevant and translatable biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease at the early stages of the disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35546164,NA,2022,10.1038/s41598-022-11582-1,,,,pubmed-35546164,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,False,00374321-95a7-4a2a-a12c-af4c0f9e599b,Laurel Renton,Excluded,Excluded

Changes in hippocampal function seem critical for cognitive impairment in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Diffusible oligomers of Aβ (oAβ) have been shown to block canonical long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 area of hippocampus, but whether there is also a direct effect of oAβ on synaptic transmission and plasticity at synapses between mossy fibers (axons) from the dentate gyrus granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons (mf-CA3 synapses) is unknown. Studies in APP transgenic mice have suggested an age-dependent impairment of mossy fiber LTP. Here we report that although endogenous AD brain-derived soluble oAβ had no effect on mossy-fiber basal transmission, it strongly impaired paired-pulse facilitation in the mossy fiber pathway and presynaptic mossy fiber LTP (mf-LTP). Selective activation of both β1 and β2 adrenergic receptors and their downstream cAMP/PKA signaling pathway prevented oAβ-mediated inhibition of mf-LTP. Unexpectedly, activation of the cGMP/PKG signaling pathway also prevented oAβ-impaired mf-LTP. Our results reveal certain specific pharmacological targets to ameliorate human oAβ-mediated impairment at the mf-CA3 synapse.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35820646,NA,2022,10.1016/j.nbd.2022.105816,,,,pubmed-35820646,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,False,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Included,Included

V.Wang M.Audrain M.Fanutza T.Kim S. H.Heja S.Readhead B.Dudley J. T.Blitzer R. D.Schadt E. E.Zhang B.Gandy S.Ehrlich M. E ",Mol Psychiatry,Mol Psychiatry,Integrative gene network approaches enable new avenues of exploration that implicate causal genes in sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) pathogenesis thereby offering novel insights for drug-discovery programs. We previously constructed a probabilistic causal network model of sporadic LOAD and identified TYROBP/DAP12 encoding a microglial transmembrane signaling polypeptide and direct adapter of TREM2 as the most robust key driver gene in the network. Here we show that absence of TYROBP/DAP12 in a mouse model of AD-type cerebral Aβ amyloidosis (APP(KM670/671NL)/PSEN1(Δexon9)) recapitulates the expected network characteristics by normalizing the transcriptome of APP/PSEN1 mice and repressing the induction of genes involved in the switch from homeostatic microglia to disease-associated microglia (DAM) including Trem2 complement (C1qa C1qb C1qc and Itgax) Clec7a and Cst7. Importantly we show that constitutive absence of TYROBP/DAP12 in the amyloidosis mouse model prevented appearance of the electrophysiological and learning behavior alterations associated with the phenotype of APP(KM670/671NL)/PSEN1(Δexon9) mice. Our results suggest that TYROBP/DAP12 could represent a novel therapeutic target to slow arrest or prevent the development of sporadic LOAD. These data establish that the network pathology observed in postmortem human LOAD brain can be faithfully recapitulated in the brain of a genetically manipulated mouse. These data also validate our multiscale gene networks by demonstrating how the networks intersect with the standard neuropathological features of LOAD.,NA,"Department of Neurology Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai New York NY 10029 USA.

Yet, the underlying patho-mechanisms remain unknown and treatments limited. To better understand the molecular changes associated with AD, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of candidate genes linked to the disease, like the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA1. However, demonstration of whether and how these genes cause pathology is largely lacking. Here, utilising fly genetics, we generated the first Drosophila model of human wild-type and P460L mutant EphA1 and tested the effects of Eph/ephrin signalling on AD-relevant behaviour and neurophysiology. We show that EphA1 mis-expression did not cause neurodegeneration, shorten lifespan or affect memory but flies mis-expressing the wild-type or mutant receptor were hyper-aroused, had reduced sleep, a stronger circadian rhythm and increased clock neuron activity and excitability. Over-expression of endogenous fly Eph and RNAi-mediated knock-down of Eph and its ligand ephrin affected sleep architecture and neurophysiology. Eph over-expression led to stronger circadian morning anticipation while ephrin knock-down impaired memory. A dominant negative form of the GTPase Rho1, a potential intracellular effector of Eph, led to hyper-aroused flies, memory impairment, less anticipatory behaviour and neurophysiological changes. Our results demonstrate a role of Eph/ephrin signalling in a range of behaviours affected in AD. This presents a starting point for studies into the underlying mechanisms of AD including interactions with other AD-associated genes, like Rho1, Ankyrin, Tau and APP with the potential to identify new targets for treatment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35569721,NA,2022,10.1016/j.nbd.2022.105752,,,,pubmed-35569721,01/20/2023 12:32:01,5f2d7848-db20-4459-9bb8-a96cc294e3fa,Pilot citations,False,03cea30e-171a-4e15-b7c1-daf08ddf68d6,Ella Lambert,Excluded,Excluded

Here, we explore the contribution of lymphocytes on microglia reactivity in SMA mice and investigate how SMN deficiency alters the reactive profile of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia. We show that microglia adopt a reactive morphology in spinal cords of SMA mice. Ablating lymphocytes did not alter the reactive morphology of SMA microglia and did not improve the survival or motor function of SMA mice, indicating limited impact of peripheral immune cells on the SMA phenotype. We found iPSC-derived SMA microglia adopted an amoeboid morphology and displayed a reactive transcriptome profile, increased cell migration, and enhanced phagocytic activity. Importantly, cell morphology and electrophysiological properties of motor neurons were altered when they were incubated with conditioned media from SMA microglia.

Y.Koh Y. H.Kim J.Koo J. W.We Y. M.Hoe H. S ",Front Mol Neurosci,Front Mol Neurosci,Recently we reported that ALWPs which we developed by combining Liuwei Dihuang pills (LWPs) with antler regulate the LPS-induced neuroinflammatory response and rescue LPS-induced short- and long-term memory impairment in wild-type (WT) mice. In the present study we examined the effects of ALWPs on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and cognitive function in WT mice as well as 5x FAD mice (a mouse model of AD). We found that administration of ALWPs significantly reduced amyloid plaque levels in 5x FAD mice and significantly decreased amyloid β (Aβ) levels in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-overexpressing H4 cells. In addition ALWPs administration significantly suppressed tau hyperphosphorylation in 5x FAD mice. Oral administration of ALWPs significantly improved long-term memory in scopolamine (SCO)-injected WT mice and 5x FAD mice by altering dendritic spine density. Importantly ALWPs promoted spinogenesis in primary hippocampal neurons and WT mice and modulated the dendritic spine number in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner. Taken together our results suggest that ALWPs are a candidate therapeutic drug for AD that can modulate amyloid plaque load tau phosphorylation and synaptic/cognitive function.,NA,"Department of Neural Development and Disease Korea Brain Research Institute (KBRI) Daegu South Korea.
